3.3 Doctrine of separation of powers
• Separation of powers is a doctrine of constitutional law
under which the three branches of government (executive,
legislative, and judicial) are kept separate.
• This is also known as the system of checks and balances,
because each branch is given certain powers so as to check and
balance the other branches.
• Montesquieu (1689–1755) concluded that the best form of
government was one in which the legislative, executive,
and judicial powers were separate and kept each other in
check to prevent any branch from becoming too powerful.
He believed that uniting these powers, as in the monarchy of
Louis XIV, would lead to despotism.
3.3 Doctrine of separation of powers
• 1649 Civil war in England and beheading of King
• Hobbes ((1588–1679): Leviathan, a defense of the absolute power of kings: Life
in state on nature: solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” Social contract:
Absolute power King (church support). Individual should obey the king or
choose death. To follow Enlightenment thinkers; improve human conditions on
earth valued reason, science, religious tolerance, and what they called “natural
rights”—life, liberty, and property (EXECUTIVE)
• Locke (1632–1704):Two Treatises of Government, natural rights such as life, liberty,
and property (“inalienable”)_impossible to surrender. Government, he said, was
mainly necessary to promote the “public good,” that is to protect property and
encourage commerce and little. only adult male property owners should
have the right to vote (rest unfit). The supreme authority of government, Locke
said, should reside in the law-making legislature, like England’s Parliament.
The executive (prime minister) and courts would be creations of the
legislature and under its authority. (LEGISLATURE)
3.3 Doctrine of separation of powers
• Montesquieu (1689–1755): The Spirit of the Laws, in 1748; state of nature individuals were
so fearful that they avoided violence and war. The need for food, Montesquieu said, caused
the timid humans to associate with others and seek to live in a society. “As soon as man
enters into a state of society,” “he loses the sense of his weakness, equality ceases, and
then commences the state of war.” and purpose of government is to maintain law and
order, political liberty, and the property of the individual. best form of government was one
in which the legislative, executive, and judicial powers were separate and kept each other in
check to prevent any branch from becoming too powerful. [SEPERATION]
• Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778); state of nature as free, equal, peaceful, and happy.
When people began to claim ownership of property, Rousseau argued, inequality, murder,
and war resulted. he powerful rich stole the land belonging to everyone and fooled the
common people into accepting them as rulers. Rousseau concluded that the social contract
was not a willing agreement, but a fraud against the people committed by the rich. The Social
Contract. His opening line is still striking today: “Man is born free, and everywhere he is in
chains.” the individual should never be forced to give up his or her natural rights to a king.
democracy, anyone who disobeyed the general will of the people “will be forced to be free.” All
political power must reside with the people, exercising their general will. people, meeting
together, will deliberate individually on laws and then by majority vote find the general will.
There should be government, but it would be composed of “mere officials” who got their
orders from the people. “As soon as any man says of the affairs of the State, ‘What does it matter
to me?’ the State may be given up for lost.” [PEOPLE]

“As soon as any man says of the affairs of the State, ‘What does it matter to me?’ the State may be
given up for lost.”
• Natural justice is a concept of common law and represents
higher procedural principles developed by the courts,
which every judicial, quasi-judicial and administrative
agency must follow while taking any decision adversely
affecting the rights of a private individual.
• In short, natural justice implies [FEE]
1. Fairness,
2. Equity, and
3. Equality
3.4 Principles of natural justice
(Read Annex 10: Principles of Natural Justice & 9 SoP)
It is basically a technical terminology for the:
• Rule against bias (nemo judex in causa sua) and
• The right to a fair hearing (audi alteram partem).
While the term natural justice is often retained as a general concept, it
has largely been replaced and extended by the
• 'general duty to act fairly'.
• The basis for the rule against bias is the need to maintain
public confidence in the legal system. Bias can take the form
of actual bias, imputed bias, or apparent bias. The mere fact
that a decision affects the rights or interests is sufficient to subject
the decision to the procedures required by natural justice.

• An order of Habeas corpus (appear in person)
3.4.1 Characteristics of BORs
• The power of judicial control gives practical effect to the ideal of
rule of law. In other words, judiciary by directing and monitoring the
functioning of the executive ensures that it acts within the limits of
the powers conferred on it by law and thus refrains the executive from
arbitrary exercise of power.
• The control exercised by the Courts over the administration is called
judicial control, that is, to. the power of the court to keep the
administrative acts within the limits of law. It also implies. the right
of an aggrieved citizen to challenge the wrongful act of
administration in the court of. law.
• The executive branch can declare Executive Orders, which are like
proclamations that carry the force of law, but the judicial branch
can declare those acts unconstitutional.
3.5 Judicial control of the Executive
• In Kenya’s jurisprudence JR is anchored in the FAA Act
(2015), a statute enacted to give effect to Art. 47 of COK
2010.
• Nwabueze defines JR as “the power of the court, in appropriate
proceeding before it, to declare a governmental measure either
contrary to, or in accordance with, the constitution or other
governing law with the effect of rendering the measure invalid or void
or vindicating its validity”
3.5.1 What is Grounds for judicial
review(JR)
• Irrationality (unreasonableness) Associated Provincial Picture House Ltd. v
Wednesbury Corporation (Wednesbury unreasonableness).
• See Nancy Barasa V JSC (Argument JCS has conducted itself rationally A168(1)(e) COK, JS Code
of Conduct and Ethics, Legal Notice 50 of 2003.)
• Illegality: DM body Overlooks procedural requirements. Act on powers they do not
have (Ultra vires doctrine). Abuse of absolute discretion. Exceeds lawful
jurisdictions as provided in FAAA S 7(2)(a)(ii). See R V CS of Interior ex parte Gragory
Oriaro Nyauchi & 4 others the applicant case was omission of Moi Day by the responder as
a Public holiday amounted to an illegality (S7 6th Schedule of COK). Note substance ultra
vires if NEMA assumes jurisdiction over educational stds in schools
• Impropriety (Procedural Impropriety). See Pastoli v Kabale District Local
Government Counsle & others (2008) by Kasule J in UG. Failure to act fairly by DM authority in
DM process. E.g. non observance to Rules on NJ or to act with procedural unfairness
3.5.2 Grounds for judicial review(JR)
(III)
• Ultra Vires (beyond the scope of power):
• Substantive UV: Going against the laid down framework (un-allowed. The scope and way of
application) See AG v Fulham Corporation
• Procedural UV: Mandatory procedurals requirement must be strictly adhered to by the authority
in question. See John Kipng’eno Koech v Nakuru Count assemble & 5 Others (2013)
• Jurisdiction Error: Is about power and competency in the administrative structure of the
State: A body acting on power it is not delegated to or in excess. (Gachagua on Shamba
system):
• Mandate;
• Exceed;
• Decline.
Case Gladys Boss Shollei v JCS & others [2014]. She was not given space for rebuttal.

• Fail to ascertain what the law say about a certain matter
• Misinterpret the law concerned

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE
RESOLUTION (ADR)
TOPIC 5
5.1 Nature of alternative dispute resolutions (ADR)
5.2 General principles of ADR
5.3 Mediation
5.4 Negotiation
5.5 Conciliation
5. Alternative dispute resolutions
5.1 NATURE OF ADR
The Constitution of Kenya [Article 159(2)(c)]
• Mediation
• Negotiation
• Arbitration
• Reconciliation
• Conciliation
5.2 GEN. PRINCIPLES OF OF
ADR
• Confidentialities
• Authority
• Voluntary
• Neutral
• Non-binding (Arbitration _ Exception)
• Non-imposing
5.3 Negotiation
• Conducted by the parties
• Is flexible & simple
• Friendly
• Cheap
• Maintain relations between parties
• Maintains privacy
• Can be abused
• Not binding
5.3.1 Positional v Principled Negotiation
Positional Negotiation Principled Negotiation
• occurs when people
negotiate according to their
positions or statements of
what they want to get out of
the situation.
• Positional bargaining is a form
of distributive bargaining
where both parties view the
conflict as a win-lose situation
• negotiators rely on objective criteria—a
fair, independent standard—to settle
their differences. For example, they might
agree to abide by standards such as market
value, expert opinion, industry
• Principled negotiation is interest based.
Each party is concerned about the other(s)
based on a vested interest in maintaining a
relationship once the deal is completed.
• Focus is a win-win
5.3 Elements of Principled
Negotiation
• 1. Separate the people from the problem. Strong emotions can become wrapped up
with the substantive issues in a negotiation and complicate it even further.
• 2. Focus on interests, not positions. Negotiators often waste time arguing over who
should get their way or, alternatively, trying to find a compromise point in between the
two firm positions they have staked.
• 3. Invent options for mutual gain. In principled negotiation, negotiators devote
significant time to brainstorming a wide range of possible options before choosing the
best one.
• 4. Insist on using objective criteria. For example, they might agree to abide by
standards such as market value, expert opinion, industry protocol, or law. Importantly,
parties should agree in advance about which objective criteria to consult and agree to
abide by the outcome.
• Don’t Forget Your BATNA (best alternative to a negotiated agreement,)
5.3 Negotiation
• Employers & labour unions e.g. T.S.C. and
K.N.U.T.
• Competing intellectual property claims
• Territorial rights between competing
businesses e.g. average milk suppliers
5.4 Mediation
• Involves a neutral 3
rd party - mediator
• Fast
• Cheap
•Private
• Friendly
• Simple
• Not binding
• Parties can leave at their
own will
5.2 PRINCIPLES of Mediation
• Confidentialities
• Authority
• Voluntary
• Neutral
• Non-binding (Arbitration _ Exception)
• Non-imposing
5.4 Mediation
• Kofi Annan led mediation
https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001292470/
kofi-annan-the-man-who-saved-kenya
