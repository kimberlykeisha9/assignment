         6.2 Nationality, citizenship &
                   domicile
Nationality:
• The relationship between a person and a particulate state for which he is a citizen (Laibuta p. 20)
• The legal status of a nationality, or citizenship, entitles a person to enjoy certain legal rights,
   freedoms and privileges safeguarded by the law of the state of which 9s)he is a national
• The status may be acquired by birth, registration, or nationalization or may be lost by
   renunciation or deprivation in accordance with the Kenta Citizen ship Act (Chapt 170)
Fenwick
• Defines it as a bond which unites a person to a given state which constitutes his membership in
   the particular state, which gives him a claim to the protection of that state and which subjects
   him to the obligation created by the laws of that state.
• The basis of nationality is the membership of a particular community.
           6.2 Nationality, citizenship
                   & domicile
International importance of the nationality;
• Nationality is often determined by the state laws. It is a link through which an individual
    can enjoy the benefits of international law.
• Starke state its importance as under;
    1)    Protection of rights of diplomatic agents
    2)    Prevention of offences
    3)    Loyalty to particular state
    4)    State can refuse to extradite its own nationals
    5)    Enemy character is determined on the basis of nationality
    6)    Jurisdiction of state over their nationals
            6.2 Nationality, citizenship &
                                      domicile
Modes of acquisition and loss of nationality;
A) Acquisition of nationality
1. By birth; That is nationality is conferred at birth by the fact either of birth within the state territory (jus soli) or
     by the descent from, one of its nationals (jus sanguinis). According to jus soli the birth occurs is the decisive
     factor and according to the jus sanguinins and the parentage.
2.   By naturalization; It may take place by means of marriage, legitimization, option, domicile, or appointment as
     government officials and on the application. It is administrative fact of the state conferring citizenship upon alien.
3.   By registration of resumption; Those individuals who were natural born subjects of the state but who lost their
     original nationality on account of some cause may get back it on fulfilling certain conditions.
4.   By descent; It is on the basis of nationality of parents, this is also known as jus sanguinins. UK and USA also
     recognize this principle
5.   By subjugation; After the conquest. When the part of a state is subjugated by another state the inhabitants of
     that state become the nationals of the later state.
6.   By cession; When a part of the state is ceded, all nationals of the former state become nationals of the later
     state.
           6.2 Nationality, citizenship &
                     domicile
B) Loss of nationality
1. By release; For it, it is necessary to submit an application for the loss of nationality by
     release.
2.   By deprivation; Some laws of the state, provides that if a national of its state seeks
     employment of government of another state without its permission, he will be deprived of
     his nationality
3.   Long residence abroad; State laws of many states contain provisions in this connection
     that if a person resides for a long period abroad, his nationality ends
4.   By renunciation; When a person acquires a nationality of more than one state, he have to
     renounce his nationality of one state.
5.   Substitution; As to this principle, a person may get nationality of state in place of the
     nationality of another state, and whereby he loses his nationality of one state and acquires
     the other state.
             6.2 Nationality, citizenship &
Citizenship:
                       domicile
• The word citizenship is often used in municipal law.
• Definition; Generally the national who enjoys full political and civil rights is called a citizen. The state of being
    a native of a city and enjoying the freedom and privileges of the city, in which he resides.
• It is intimately connected with the civil rights.
Refer: To the constitutional status of a person.( Chapter 3 CITIZENSHIP COK)
Difference between nationality and citizenship:
• By nationality we mean that legal relationship which exists between the nation and the individual, on the other
    hand, citizenship denotes the relationship between the person and the state law
• By nationality the civil and natural rights of a person may come under international law and by citizenship it is
    the sole concern of the state law
• It is possible that all the citizens may possess the nationality of a particular state, but it is not possible that all the
    nationals may be the citizens of that particular state.
• Citizens possess full political rights in a state, but a national may not possess such rights

                 6.2 Nationality, citizenship &
                           domicile
Domicile: Domicile is an attribute of nationality and denotes a person’s place of residence.
And, It is the relationship between the individual and locality, where he has his permanent
home.
Difference between nationality and domicile
• Domicile denotes the residence of the person, while nationality denotes relationship of man
   with his nation.
• Consequently a person may acquire nationality through domicile.
Difference between domicile and citizenship:
• Citizenship has reference to the political status of a person and
• Domicile to his civil rights.
                         6.3 Artificial persons
• In law, a human person is called a natural person (sometimes also a physical person), and a non-human
    person is called a juridical person (sometimes also a juridic, juristic, artificial, legal, or fictitious
    person, Latin: persona ficta).
•   Juridical persons: Corporations, Firms (in some jurisdictions), and many Government agencies.
•   Commonly (incorporating a business), legal personality is usually acquired by registration with
    a government agency set up for the purpose.
•   In other cases it may be by primary legislation (judiciary, IEBC etc):
•   The UN SDG 16 advocates for the provision of legal identity for all, including birth registration
    by 2030.
•   As legal personality is a prerequisite to legal capacity:
      • Ability of any legal person to amend – i.e. enter into, transfer, etc.
      • Rights and obligations
• A prerequisite for an international organization to be able to sign international treaties in its
    own name.
                  6.3.1 Legal persons

• In law, a legal person is any person or 'thing' (less ambiguously, any legal entity)
   that can do the things a human person is usually able to do in law – such as enter
   into contracts, sue and be sued, own property etc
• "legal person" is that some legal persons are not people:
   companies and corporations are "persons" legally speaking: an legally do most
   of the things an ordinary person can do, but they are not people in a literal sense.
• There are therefore two kinds of legal entities:
     • human and
     • non-human.
     6.4 Unincorporated Associations
                 (UAs)

• An unincorporated association is defined as an association of two or more persons
    formed for some religious, educational, charitable, social or other non-
    commercial purpose.
•   UAs are one vehicle for people to cooperate towards a common goal.
•   The range of possible UAs is nearly limitless, but typical examples are:
     • An amateur football team who agree to hire a pitch once a week and split the cost.
     • Residents of a street who agree to pay into a collective fund for street sweeping, etc.
     • A co-operative.
     • A trade union.
     • A professional association.
                  6.4 Unincorporated associations
                              (UAs)
•   Most significant feature of an association is exactly that they are unincorporated: i.e., they lack legal
    personality.
•   UAs are cheap and easy to form, requiring a bare minimum of formalities to bring them into existence.
•   Indeed, the common law on contracts means they can even be formed without their members realising it.
•   They are also extremely flexible, with examples of tiny associations of just a few people, and national
    organisations with thousands of members.
•   Whether or not a group of people is an unincorporated association is not always clear. A summary definition
    is
       • a group of people
       • gathered for a common purpose
       • but not for profit
       • intending to create a legally binding relationship between themselves
                            6.4 UAs
• There is no statutory definition of an UA so it has fallen to judges to
  define them.
• In the leading case, Conservative and Unionist Central Office v Burrell, Lord
  Justice Lawton defined an UA as [T]wo or more persons bound together
  for one or more common purposes, not being business purposes, by
  mutual undertakings, each having mutual duties and obligations, in an
  organisation which has rules which identify in whom control of it and its
  funds rests and upon what terms and which can be joined or left at will.“
                           6.4.1 UAs Essential
                                 elements
1.    that there exist members of the association;
2.    that there is a contract binding them
3.    that they have a common purpose which is not business;
4.    there must have been a moment in time when a number of persons came together to form the association
      although those persons need not be the present member
5.     it is not a legal person.
6.    Their legal basis is the general law of contract (including contracts of agency), which governs the agreements
      the members make with each other.
7.    UAs are entirely private concerns.
8.    Some may have structure and governance: Constitution; Objects or purposes (suffer frustration of
      contract) (GSS); Members (consent); Committee (trustees for the members, and have a fiduciary
      duty towards them); The Chair (presides over meetings); Other officers (eg treasurer, secretary);
9.   Liability (no legal personality: deal with specific member law of agency): Once liability of one or more
     persons is established, their liability is unlimited
                             6.4.1 UAs Essential
                                   elements
1. Legal difficulties: No legal personality, cant hold property (device mechanism)
2. Nature of held rights: (such as assets, are held by voluntary association) Joint tenancy or tenants in
   common. This has the result that the member can receive his or her own share (allowing for severance in the
   case of joint tenants) irrespective of the other members, in the same way that a joint owner of a business can
   do so. In Bowman v Secular Society this construction was even applied to a gift given to be applied for the general
   purposes of the association.
3. On trust for the purposes of the association (The second alternative is that the gift is to the trustees, or
   those officers who might properly be considered trustees, to be held on trust for the purposes of the
   association in a private purpose trust)
4. Contract-holding (The third alternative is that members hold the property as beneficial owners, but are
   bound by their contracts inter se as to their ability to take out their share.) See Re Recher’s Will Trusts in
   relation to a gift to the Anti-Vivisection Society, although, on the facts, that society was considered no longer
   in existence and the gift failed for this reason.[17] One statement of when such an absolute gift will be
   considered to have been made was given in Re Lipinski’s Will Trusts
         6.4.1 UAs Essential elements
1. Where the donee association is itself the beneficiary of the prescribed purpose ... the gift should be construed
   as an absolute one ... the more so where, if the purpose is carried out, the members can by appropriate action
   vest the resulting property in themselves, for here the trustees and the beneficiaries are the same persons.
   Stated in Hanchett‐Stamford v Attorney‐General [2008] EWHC 330 (Ch), where Lewison J stated: This
   "contract-holding" theory is now considered the dominant theory in the field
2. In practice: (circumstantial)
3. Distribution of rights upon dissolution (The distribution of rights in such a case depends upon how those
   rights are determined to be held) including Bona Vacantia
4. Bona vacantia: Before the Hanchett Stamford case, it was suggested that the assets of an association that
   dissolves in certain circumstances would be bona vacantia (vacant goods and is the name given to ownerless
   property, which by law passes to the Crown))
5. Libel: Lack of legal personality means an unincorporated association ordinarily has no standing to sue for libel
    6.5 Incorporate associations (IAs)
•   An IA is a registered legal entity that's usually established for recreational, cultural or charitable purposes. It
    must have at least 5 members and put all profits back into the association's activities. (Read Association
    Registration Act 2015 Laws of Kenya*)
•   Benefits of incorporation
      • continue regardless of changes to membership
      • accept gifts, bequests and grants
      • buy and sell property
      • enter into enforceable contracts
      • sue or be sued
      • invest and borrow money
      • Incorporating your club is not compulsory. If you do incorporate, there are rules you must follow.
       6.5 Incorporate associations (IAs)
•   How to register as an incorporated association
      • Hold a meeting with members to vote on whether your organization wants to incorporate.
      • You must get a majority of votes to authorize a person to incorporate the association and approve proposed
          rules that comply with the Associations
      • Search the names; states the purpose/objectives
      • Age of minority
•   Other things to consider: Membership requirements
             • qualifications for membership
             • quorums for meetings
             • provisions for elections
             • Profits and financial reporting
             • Incorporated associations are non-profit organisations. This means profits
               can't be distributed to members for personal gain, but must be used to
               achieve the objectives of the association.
             • Limited liability for members
6.5 Incorporate associations (IAs)
 • Incorporated associations can own and fully control property. If the organisation
     is sued, members and officers of incorporated associations: are protected against
     personal responsibility for any debts or liabilities that the association incurs have
     personal liability limited to outstanding fees
 •   This is different to members or office-bearers of unincorporated associations,
     who can be sued or held personally liable for the debts of the organisation.
 •   Receiving bequests, gifts and funding
 •   An incorporated association can invest a bequest, or gift, given through a will. It
     can also borrow money and operate a bank account in its own name.
 •   It's sometimes easier for an incorporated association to get government funding
     because of the association's stable structure.
              6.6 Co-operative societies
• Cooperative societies are formed with the aim of helping their members. This type of
   business organisation is formed mainly by weaker sections of the society in order to
   prevent any type of exploitation from the economically stronger sections of the society.
• Cooperatives are people-centred enterprises owned, controlled and run by and for
   their members to realise their common economic, social, and cultural needs and
   aspirations. Cooperatives bring people together in a democratic and equal way.
• The SACCO Societies Regulatory Authority (SASRA) is the government's principal
   agency responsible for the supervision and regulation of SACCO Societies in Kenya. It is
   established pursuant to the provisions the Sacco Societies Act, No. 14 of 2008.

                             societies
•   The main aim is to protect the economic interest of the people by eliminating the middlemen. One of its
    major functions includes providing loans at a low rate of interest to its members and weaker sections of
    society. A cooperative society works with the aim of self-help basically for its members.

         6.6.3 Management of co-operative
                     societies
•   Cooperative management should be regarded as a team consisting of four elements — members (owners), board of directors
    (elected), the manager (hired), and other responsible employees (paid). Each part of the team has its own distinctive
    duties and responsibilities for performing management functions in a cooperative

 7.0 Basic principles of tort
What is tort?
• It is a civil wrong in the sense that it is committed against an
  individual (which includes legal entities such as companies)
  rather than the state.
• The gist of tort law is that a person has certain interests which are
  protected by law.
• These interests can be protected by a court awarding a sum of
  money, known as damages, for infringement of a protected interest.
• Alternatively, by the issuing of an injunction - which is a court order,
  to the defendant to refrain from doing something.
• There are increasingly limited circumstances where the victim of a tort
  may avail himself of self-help
 7.0.1 Basic principles of tort
• The Four Elements of a Tort
• The accused had a duty, in most personal injury cases, to
  act in a way that did not cause you to become injured.
• The accused committed a breach of that duty.
• An injury occurred to you.
• The breach of duty was the proximate cause of your
  injury.
 7.0.2 The basic pattern in in tort?

• The paradigm tort consists of an act or omission by the
  defendant which causes damage to the claimant.
• The damage must be caused by the fault of the
  defendant and must be a kind of harm recognized as
  attracting legal liability
• Act (or omission) + causation + fault + protected
  interest + damage = liability
 7.0.3 Variation in pattern in tort?

• There are certain torts which do not require fault. These are
  known as torts of strict liability
• In some cases the act or omission of the defendant may
  have caused damage to the claimant but the claimant may
  have no action as the interest affected may not be one protected
  by law. Lawyers refer to this as damnum sine injuria or harm
  without legal wrong
• There are also cases where conduct is actionable even though
  no damage has been caused. This is known as injuria sine
  damno and where a tort is actionable without proof of damage
  it is said to be actionable per se
 7.0.4 The interests protected
• Personal interest: personal security;
      •   Fear of being hit> tort of assault
      •   Blow is stuck> tort of battery
      •   Freedom restricted (unlawfully)> sue for false imprisonment (intentional tort)
      •   Personal injury is caused> action in tort of negligence
      •   Psychiatric damage (witness traumatic event-Westgate; Dusit)
      •   Consent to treatment and R2L* Law & morality (kavonokia)*
• Interest in property: Nuisance > Ryland v Fletchers; Trespass to Land; interest in personal
   property> tort (trespass to goods and conversion); Cloth or care damage> action for damage in
   negligence
• Economic interest: Economic tort (ltd protection- tort and contract intersect): common law
   cautious in draining line (btw (un)lawful business practice): Q ECC. loss (physical damage or
   ‘pure ECC. loss’)
• Reputation and privacy: untrue speech or writing > action in tort of defamation

 7.0.5 The Role of policy
• Consideration:
    •   Duty of care;
    •   Remoteness of damage;
    •   Fault etc.
• Questions to ask:
    •   Was there duty?
    •   Was damage too remote?
    •   Was defendant at fault?
• Formal conceptualization (black letter law)
• 2 Policy Factors:
    •   1) Opening the floodgate of litigation:
    •   2) The Role of insurance (pay most damages in tort)
    7.0.6 The Role of insurance
•   Without insurance:
      •   Tort system would cease to operate
      •   Many people would afford to pay awarded damages
•   Insurance
      •   Property loss: 1st party insurance (insurable risk)
      •   Damage to 3rd party: insurer indemnify the insured
      •   3rd party: must establish the insured liability
      •   1st & 3rd party insurance: personal injuries or death
•   1st insurance
      •   Life insurance
      •   Personal accident insurance
      •   Permanent health insurance
      •   Formal conceptualization (black letter law)
•   M/V accidents: damager awsrd (e.g. 5M etc.): M/V 3rd party insurance by law
•   Professional indemnity (Advocates, doctors): sued for professional negligence
     7. 1 Negligence: causation &
        remoteness of damages
• Negligence is one of those torts in which damages must be
  proved.
• Once a breach of duty has been established, the claimant must
  therefore also show that the breach has resulted in injury of
  damage (the causation issue) and
• That the injury or damage is sufficiently closely connected to
  the breach (the remoteness issue).
• Where a further event occurs after the breach of duty, which
  contributes to the damage, this later even may amount to a novus
  actus interveniens.("new intervening act“)
• It breaks the chain of causation and renders any new damage
  too remote from the defendant’s breach of duty.
              7.1.1 Causation

• Causation is relevant to all torts in which proof of
  damage is essential.
• Ordinarily the claimant must prove that the
  damage suffered was caused by the defendant’s
  breach of duty and that it was not too remote.
• The former element is often referred to as
  causation in fact and the latter as causation in law.
                     7.1.1 Causation
• Causation in fact: whether as a matter of fact the damage was
   caused by the breach of duty.
• “a person found dead on a railway crossing having been run over by a train
   that failed to sound a warning before using the crossing, all the elements of
   negligence are present.”
• The railway company owes a duty of care to persons using the
   crossing.
• A breach of duty by not sounding a warning. The claimant has
   suffered damage.
• But no negligence action until it is established that the train that
   ran over the claimant was the one that failed to sound a
   warning
 7.1.1.1 Causation: The basic rule
         (the “but for” test)
• If the damage would not have occurred but for the
  defendant’s breach of duty, then the breach of
  duty is the cause for the damage.
• It is sufficient to show that on a balance of
  probabilities the breach was the cause of the
  damage, or that it is more likely than not that the
  breach was a cause of the damage.
• In principle it is “an all or nothing question”.
     7.1.1.1 Causation: The basic rule
             (the “but for” test)
• Several situation to consider
1.  There may be doubt about the natural course of events would have been if the defendant had
      behaved properly. In Barnett v Chelsea and Kensington Hospital Management
      Committee, [1969] 1 QB 428. diagnosis and treatment could not have affective in preventing
      claimants husbands death. (vomiting) : Breach of duty (examination) was bot a cause of his
      death.
2.    There may be doubt about how the defendant would subsequently have behaved if he had done
      what he should have done in performance of the duty (omission to act). In Bolitho v City
      and Hackney Health Authority. A young child, who had a history of respiratory problems
      [1998] AC 232. The doctor would nt have intubated there4 her negiligence faulure to attend
      didnt cause the death (boy).
3.    There may be doubt about how the claimant would subsequently have behaved if the
      defendant had done what should have been done. Doctor (D) failed to warn the patient
      about the risk of treatment: would the patient have decided to have the treatment anyway. If so,
      the failure to warn cannot be a cause of the damage if one of the risk occurs. If
      Employers (D) may have failed to provide safety equipment for their employee: would the
      deceased employee have used it if it had been provided? If not, then the failure to provide
      it was not the cause of the injuries. See McWilliams v Sir William Arrol [1962] 1 All ER 623
         7.1.1.2 Multiple causes

• Suppose that David and Daniel Acting independently at the same
  moment shoot Conrad, who dies instantly: either shot
  would have been fatal. Logically, each assailant could say that
  he was not the cause of death, because, even if he had not been
  there, the other shot would still have killed Conrad. On
  this reasoning neither defendants would be liable. Such a result
  would be absurd. In such a case the court would hold that
  both David and Daniel were liable, leaving them to contest
  the matter between themselves.
                     7.1.1.2 Multiple causes
• McGhee v National Coal Board [1973]
• Facts: McGhee was an employee the National Coal Board, and generally worked emptying pipe
   kilns. However, one day he cleaned out brick kilns. This work caused him to get very sweaty, and
   powdered brick caked on to his skin. He then biked home without washing, because there were no
   cleaning facilities provided by the employer, and developed dermatitis. The exact way that this
   disease develops was not known at the time, but it was proven that the washing immediately after
   coming out of the kiln would have at least lessened the risk of it developing. The Coal Board was
   successful at the lower courts, which McGhee appealed.
• Issue: When a defendant has been proved to have negligently contributed to the development of
   an injury, should they be liable if it can be shown that the plaintiff ’s actions also led to the
   development, and the exact cause is unknown?
• Decision: Appeal allowed
• Reasoning: Simon of Glaisdale sums up the reasons thusly: Where an injury is caused by two or
   more factors operating cumulatively, one or more of which is a breach of duty and one or more
   of which is not so, in such a way that it is impossible to ascertain the proportion in which the
   factors were effective in producing the injury or which factor was decisive, the law does not require
   the plaintiff to prove the impossible, but holds that he is entitled to damages for the injury if he
   proves on a balance of probabilities that the breach of duty contributed substantially to causing
   the injury.
• Ratio: Material increase in risk was treated as equivalent to a material contribution to damage
               7.1.1.2 Multiple causes
• Willsher v Essex Area Health Authority [1988] 1 AC 1074 House of Lords
   A premature baby was given too much oxygen by a junior doctor. The baby
   suffered from a condition affecting his retina which left him totally blind in one
   eye and partially sighted in the other. The condition could have been caused by
   the excess oxygen he had been exposed to or it could have been caused by four
   other factors unrelated to the oxygen, but related to the premature birth. The trial
   judge found the Health Athority liable. He applied McGhee v NCB but stated that
   McGhee had reversed the burden of proof where there was more than one
   possible causes. The Health Authority appealed.
   Held:
• Appeal allowed. The defendant was in breach of duty. A junior doctor owes the
   same standard of care as a qualified doctor. McGhee did not reverse the burden of
   proof which always remains on the claimant.
                7.1.1.2 Multiple causes
• Where the causes are successive and the breach of duty of the second
   defendant causes the same type of damage as that of the first defendant, the
   “but for” test will be applied in the action against the second defendant.
• In Performance Car Ltd v Abraham [1962], the second defendant’s car
   negligently collided with the claimants car. The claimants claimed $75 as the cost
   of respray, but, at the time of the accident, the car already required a re-spray as a
   result of a collision with the first defendant. The second defendant was not liable,
   as the need for the re-spray did not arise from his breach of duty.
• The practice in this type of the cases is for the court to determine and decide the
   extent to which the first defendant is legally responsible for the consequence of
   the second event.
• See Webb v Barclays Bank plc [2001] ; Baker v Wolougby [1970]
  7.1.1.2.1 Multiple causes – concurrent

• 1.4 Multiple causes - concurrent
• Where there exist two or more causes, which operate concurrently, it may be
   factually impossible to determine which one was the cause.
• This has proved problematic not least because it is the claimant's responsibility to
   establish which one was the cause.
• On general principles the burden of proving this is on the balance of
   probabilities i.e. the claimant has to demonstrate that there is more than a
   50% likelihood of the cause being the breach of duty of the defendant.
• Where there are two causes this means the burden of proof is impossible to
   discharge leaving the claimant uncompensated often for an obvious breach
   of duty. Various formulations have arisen to circumvent the strict approach.
    7.1.1.2.1 Multiple causes – concurrent
• Bonnington Castings Ltd v Wardlaw [1956] AC 613 House of Lords
• The claimant contracted pneumoconiosis by inhaling air which contained minute
    particles of silica during the course of his employment.
•   The defendant was in breach of a statutory duty in failing to provide an extractor fan.
•   Had they installed an extractor fan the number of particles of silica that the claimant was exposed
    to would have been reduced, however, there would still be some particles present.
•   There were thus two possible causes: the guilty dust, which should not have been in the working
    environment and the innocent dust, which would have been present in any event.
•   The trial judge held that where the duty arose by statute then it was for the defendant to show that
    his breach of duty (the guilty dust) did not cause the disease. As the defendant was unable to do
    this they were liable.
•   The defendant appealed contending the burden of proof rests on the claimant.
•   Held:
    The burden of proof remains on the claimant.
•   However, the claimant only had to demonstrate that the guilty dust had made a material
    contribution to the disease.
•   He did not have to demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that the guilty dust was the sole
    cause of the disease.
       7.1.1.2.2 Novus actus interveniens
               (New intervening act)
• Where there is a new intervening act this may break the chain of causation
   removing liability from the defendant.
• The legal test applicable will depend upon whether the new action was by a third party
   or an act of the claimant
• The defendant’s breach of duty may be the cause of the claimant’s damage in the
   sense that it satisfies the “ but for” test, but some other factual cause intervening after
   the breach may be regarded as the sole cause of all or part of the claimants damage.
• The expression novus actus interveniens is often used to describe the “second rule”
   cause
• Illustration: If A negligently Knocks down B, who is subsequently run over by C driving the car
   behind, C’s action is unlikely to break the chain of causation, as this is a risk to which A’s negligence
   exposed B. But what would be the position if C has then stolen B’s wallet?
  7.1.1.2.2 Novus actus interveniens
          (New intervening act)
A novus actus interveniens may take one of the four forms
1. It may be a natural event:
• The courts are reluctant to find that an intervening natural event breaks
   the chain of causation because the claimant has no-one else to sue
• If the claimant is injured by the defendant’s negligence and then suffers
   further harm when the ambulance taking him to hospital is struck by a
   falling tree, then the chain of causation is broken
• But where the defendant negligently starts a fire and strong winds fan
   the blaze, causing it to spread to the claimant’s property, the winds do
   not break the chain of causation.
    7.1.1.2.2 Novus actus interveniens
            (New intervening act)
A novus actus interveniens may take one of the four forms
2. Novus actus interveniens - Act of 3rd party
• Where the new act is of a third party, the test is whether the act was
   foreseeable. If the act of the third party was foreseeable, the defendant
   remains liable and the chain of causation remains in tact.
• If the act of a third party is not foreseeable this will break the chain of
   causation and the defendant is not liable for the actions of the third party:
   Read Baker v TE Hopkins & Son Ltd [1959] 1 WLR 966.
3. Where the act of the third party was negligent,
• this is more likely to break the chain of causation: read Knightley v Johns
   & Ors [1982] 1 WLR 349
    7.1.1.2.2 Novus actus interveniens
            (New intervening act)
A novus actus interveniens may take one of the four forms
4. Novus actus interveniens - Act of the claimant
• Where the new intervening act is that of the claimant, the test is whether the
   claimant acted reasonably in the circumstances.
• If the claimant's actions are deemed reasonable the chain of causation
   remains in tact and the defendant is liable for the actions of the claimant.
• If, however, the claimant's actions are unreasonable in the circumstances
   the chain of causation is broken and the defendant is not liable for the
   actions of the claimant: See McKew v Holland [1969] 3 All ER 1621
       7.1.2 Remoteness of damage

• Illustration:
• Carol travels to work in Nairobi: the only convinient way is by train from her local station
   in syokimau. One day she finds that a train has been derailed outside the station and
   blocked the line. She therefore has to return home. During the morning an intruder breaks
   in and shoots her in the leg. It woul be natural for her to say , ‘ I was absent from work
   yesterday because my train was derailed.’ But it would not be natural for her to say, ‘I was
   shot in the leg yesterday because my train was derailed.’ Yet it is true that, if there had been
   no derailment, she would not have been at home and would not have been shot. There is
   however a feeling that the link between the shooting and the derailment is not close enough.
   The shooting is too remote a consequences of the derailement.
              7.1.2 Remoteness of damage
• Even where the defendant’s breach of duty is a cause in fact of the claimant’s
    damage, damages may be denied for some or all of the claimant’s injuries on the
    grounds that the breach of duty was not the legal cause of that damage.
•   In this case the damage in question is said to be too remote.
•   The remoteness issue limits the extent of the defendant’s liability.
•   Remoteness of damage relates to the requirement that the damage must be of a
    foreseeable type.
•   In negligence claims, once the claimant has established that the defendant owes them
    a duty of care and is in breach of that duty which has caused damage, they must also
    demonstrate that the damage was not too remote.
•   Remoteness of damage must also be applied to claims under the Occupiers Liability
    Acts and also to nuisance claims.
•   Remoteness of damage is often viewed as an additional mechanism of controlling
    tortious liability.
•   Not every loss will be recoverable in tort law. Originally a defendant was liable for all
    losses which were a direct consequence of the defendant's breach of duty: Re
    Polemis & Furness Withy & Company Ltd. [1921] 3 KB 560 (plunk of wood and
    sparks)
 7.1.3 The Egg skull rule: “think skull” rule
• A final aspect of remoteness of damage is the egg shell (or thin) skull rule.
• This means a defendant must take their victim as they find them.
• Ie if the victim is particularly vulnerable or has a pre-existing condition
   resulting in them suffering greater injury than would be expected in an ordinary
   person, the defendant remains responsible for the full extent of the injury:
Smith v Leech Brain [1962] 2 QB 405: A negligent inflicted burn on the lips
caused an employee to develop cancer.
• The employee had a pre-malignant condition giving him a predisposition to
   develop the disease. The defendant was liable for the damage resulting from the
   claimant’s death even though death itself was not foreseable.
• It is clear that this rule survives The “Wagon Mound” and will extend to situations
   where negligently inflicted injury is exacerbated by medicaal treatment to which
   the claimant is allergic, as in Robinson v Post Office [1974].
• The rule also applies in nervous shock cases. See Page v Smith [1995].
                                  Summary
• The standard approach to determining causation between breach of duty and
   damage is the “ but for” test- but for the defendant’s negligence, would the claimant
   have suffered the damage?
• Where there are several possible causes, the burden lies on the claimant to prove
   on the balance of probabilities that it was the defendant’s act which caused the
   harm.
• In certain limited circumstances the law might allow that where the claimant cannot
   prove which of several event caused the damage, it will be sufficient to show that
   the behaviour of the defendant materially increased the risk of harm.
• The law is reluctant to compensate for “loss of chance” of recovery in physical
   injury cases. If the claimant cannot establish that the defendant’s negligent act was
   more that 50 per cent likely to have, caussed the harm, he will receive no damages at
   all.
• Where there are multiple successive causes the court will apply the ‘but for’
   test to each potential defendant or each potential cause.
                                    Summary
• The negligent or deliberate act of a third person might break the chain of
   causation between the defendant’s act and the damage.
• Whether the defendant will be liable for the act of the third party will depend on
   foreseeability of the act of the third party.
• Where the act of the third party is a deliberate act, the court will also look at the
   degree of control the defendant had over the third party.
• The test of remoteness in most torts is a test of a reasonable foreseeability; what
   damage should a reasonable person in the position of the defendant have foreseen as a
   result of his negligent act?
• The test of remoteness for some old torts, such as tresspass, is the “direct
   consequences” test: the defendant is liable for all the direct consequences of his act.
• Where the claimant suffers extra, unforeseeable damage because of a particular
   sensitivity to harm on the part of the claimant, the “thin skull” rule will apply- the
   defendant must take the victim as he finds him.
• Issues of policy will play a part in the determination of remoteness of damage
   and, increasingly, policy has begun to determine the approach to factual causation.
                 7. 2 Strict liability
• An exception to the fault principle.
• Is a liability without fault and no need to prove fault on
    the defendant’s part.
•   Once the plaintiff (P) is proved to have suffered damage
    from the defendant’s (D) wrongful act, the D is liable
    notwithstanding whether there may have been no fault on
    his part.
•   A specific instance of strict liability is afforded by the
    Rule in Rlylands v. Fletcher:
•   However it does not mean that wrongdoer or tortfeasor has
    no defense at all.
•   Certain defenses may be available in some specific
    circumstances in case of strict liability.
               7. 2 Strict liability
• We may also distinguish between absolute liability and
  strict liability.
• Where there is absolute liability, a particular wrong is
  actionable without proof of fault on the part of the
  tortfeasor and in addition there is no defence whatsoever
  to the action.
• Where there is strict liability, a particular wrong is
  actionable without proof of fault but some defences may
  be also available.
• Strict liability may be considered in the following cases:-
   i. The Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher, (1866)
   ii. Liability for Fire, and
   iii. Liability for Animals.
                7. 2 Strict liability
• The Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher, (1866)
• The following statement is commonly called the Rule in Rylands
    v. Fletcher:
•   “The person who, for his own purposes,
•   brings on his land and collects and keeps there anything likely
    to do mischief if it escapes,
•   must keep it in at his peril and, if he does not do so,
•   is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural
    consequence of its escape”.
•   This is the rile of strict liability and negligence in this case is
    irrelevant
              7.2 Strict liability
• The Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher, (1866)
• It should be observed that the Rule refers to “anything
  likely to do mischief.”
• Although in Rylands v. Fletcher it was water which
  escaped,
• the Rule equally applies in other instances involving the
  escape of obnoxious fumes,
• poisonous leaves on the branch of a tree, bees from
  a bee-farm, electricity etc.
     7.2.1 Limits of the rule (strict
                liability)
The application of the Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher is not
automatic. The following conditions must be satisfied
before the rule can apply:-
• The defendant brought something onto his land.
   • Non-natural use of the land.
      • Something likely to do mischief.
          • Escape
              • Foreseeability.
       7.2.2 Defences in Rylands v. Fletcher
• The case of Rylands v. Fletcher itself suggested three defences available to a
   defendant in an action brought against him under this Rule:
• Plaintiff ’s Fault: Where the escape in question resulted from some fault on the
   part of the plaintiff, this may be pleaded by the defendant as a defence to an
   action brought against him by the plaintiff under the Rule. For in this case the
   plaintiff has himself brought about his own suffering.
• Act of God: Act of God is also defence to an action brought under the Rule, i.e.,
   the act occurred as a result of natural forces.
• Act of Stranger: Where the escape is caused by the intervention of person over
   whom the defendant has no control and whose intervention was not foreseeable,
   particularly where the stranger’s act was deliberate or intentional. See Rickards v.
   Lothian (1913)
• In addition to above defences, some general defences like “volenti non fit
   injuria”, (to a willing person injury is not done)
• statutory authority are also available in this rule.
7.2.3 The Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher can also
       apply in the following cases:
• The liability for fire
• The liability for animals
• The liability for fire due to negligence is actionable in tort. It is also
  a case of strict liability. Similarly, if a fire starts without negligence but is
  spreads due to negligence of a person then that person will be liable for
  damages caused by the spread of the fire.
• The liability for animals may arise in both nuisance and
  negligence. An occupier of land is liable for damage done by his cattle
  if they trespass on the land of his neighbours and thereby cause damage.
  Similarly, a person who keeps dangerous animals like lions, leopards,
  dogs etc. is liable strictly for any injury by such animals, even in the
  absence of negligence.
     7.3 Causation and Remoteness

• Damage is an essential ingredient of the tort. Until the claimant has
  suffered damage there is no action.
• The claimant must prove that the damage suffered was caused by
  the defendant's act (omission) and that it was not too remote.
• The former element is often referred to as causation in fact and the
  latter as causation in law.
• Causation in fact is concerned with the question of whether as a
  matter of fact the damage was caused by the act (omission). If a person is
  found dead on a railway crossing having been run over by a train, and a train has
  failed to sound a warning before using the crossing, all the elements of negligence are
  present. The railway company owes a duty of care to persons using the crossing. There
  is a breach of duty by not sounding a warning. The claimant has suffered damage.
      7.3 Causation and Remoteness

• But there is no negligence action until it is established that the train that ran over
   the claimant was the one that failed to sound a warning.
• Remoteness of damage arises where causation in fact is established but
   the damage is not regarded as having been legally caused by the act
   (omission).
• A cut-off point where the defendant ceases to be liable is established and beyond
   this point the damage is said to be "too remote".
• The rules for assessing remoteness of damage often operate to limit the overall
   extent of the tortfeasor's liability to the claimant.
• Where a further event occurs after the breach of duty which contributes to the
   damage, this later event may amount to a novus actus interveniens: It breaks
   the chain of causation and renders any new damage too remote.
                        7.3.1 Causation

1. The" but for" test: Anact (omission)is a cause of harm if that harm
    would not have occurred "but for" that act (omission). In Barnett v
    Chelseaand Kensington Hospital Management Committee [1969],
    (husband vomiting)
2. Multiple causes: Where it is uncertain that the defendant's act
    (omission)has caused the damage, what degree of probability of
    harm must be established by the claimant? In cases of traumatic harm, such as
    injuries caused by a car, the mere presence of the car on the road and the evidence of
    impact between car and the human being can be treated as proof of cause of the
    pedestrian's injuries. The claimant faces greater difficulty when there are
    multiple possible causes of the damage sustained. See. McGhee v
    National Coal Board [1973] (Black Klins)
                           7.3.1 Causation

3. Loss of Chance: English courts have shown a reluctance to evaluate loss of a
chance in tort actions, although it has been more easily accepted in breach of contract
cases. The facts of Hotson v East Berkshire Area Health Authority [1987] (boy fell
from the tree)
4. Multiple successive causes: Where the causes are successive and the breach of
duty of the second defendant causes the same type of damage as that of the first
defendant, the "but for" test will be applied in the action against the second defendant.
In Performance Cars Ltd v Abraham [1962], (car respray
5. Novus actus interveniens: The defendant's breach of duty may be a cause of the
claimant's damage in the sense that it satisfies the "but for" test, but some other factual
cause intervening after the breach may be regarded as the sole cause of all or part of
the claimant's damage. The expression novus actus interveniens is often used to describe
this "second" cause
                          7.3.1 Causation

Novus actus interveniens
• If A negligently knocks down B, who is subsequently run over by C driving the car
   behind, C's action is unlikely to break the chain of causation, as this is a risk to which
   A's negligence exposed B. But what would the position be if C had then stolen B's
   wallet?
• The law in this area can hardly be described as clear and the courts' policy objectives may
   frequently be obscured by formalistic reasoning. Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co
   Ltd [1970],
A novus actus interveniens may take one of four forms.
(continued)
 7.3.1.1 A novus actus interveniens may
            take 1 of 4 forms.
1. It may be a natural event
• The courts are reluctant to find that an intervening natural event
  breaks the chain of causation because the claimant (c) has no one else to
  sue if the D is exonerated, but where the natural event causes damage
  simply because the D's breach of duty has placed the C or his property in
  a position where that damage can be caused, the chain of causation is
  broken, unless the natural event was likely to happen.
• If C is injured by the D's negligence and then suffers further harm when
  the ambulance taking him to hospital is struck by a falling tree, then the
  chain of causation is broken, but where the D negligently starts a fire and
  strong winds fan the blaze, causing it to spread to the claimant's property,
  the winds do not break the chain of causation.
        7.3.1.1 A novus actus interveniens
2. It may be the non-deliberate act of a third party
• An example of a negligent intervening act can be seen in Knightly v Johns [1982].
• D had negligently caused a traffic accident at the exit of a tunnel.
• A police officer managing the accident scene sent the C policeman on his motorbike against
    the traffic in the tunnel to close the other end of the tunnel.
• The policeman was then injured in a second accident and sued the first driver, who argued
    that the negligence of the managing police officer in sending the policeman against the
    traffic had broken the chain of causation between the original negligence and the
    harm.
• The COA: to determine whether a non-deliberate act amounted to a novus actus interveniens,
    2Qs needed to be asked.
      1) Was the whole sequence of events a natural and probable consequence of the
      defendant's negligence such that the consequence was reasonably foreseeable to the
      defendant and not just a possibility.
      2) Could the action of the intervening person be categorised as legally negligent, as
      negligent conduct was more likely to break the chain of causation than conduct which is
      not negligent.
• On the facts, D could not reasonably have foreseen that the police officer would require the
    policeman to take the risk of riding against the traffic as a consequence of the accident.
    Thus, the actions of the police officer broke the chain of causation.
          7.3.1.1 A novus actus interveniens
3. It may be the deliberate act of a third party
• Where the D's duty is to guard the claimant or his property against damage from a 3rd
  , the 3rd party act will not break the chain of causation. In Stansbie v Troman
  [1948] the D decorator was told to lock the door when he went out. He failed to do
  so and the C's jewelry was stolen. The thief's action did not break the chain of
  causation.
• See also Smith v Littlewoods Organisation Ltd [1987], in which the owner of an
  empty building failed to keep it secure. Debris accumulated and vandals started a fire
  which spread and damaged neighbouring properties. The HoLs held that there was no
  specific duty to prevent damage from fire resulting from vandalism on these facts,
  because the owner had not known of the vandalism in the area nor of previous
  attempts to light fires.
• Two of the Law Lords stated that liability in negligence for harm caused by 3rd parties
  could only arise in 3 special circumstances:
     1. where a special relationship existed between claimant and defendant;
     2. where the defendant created the source of the damage and it was reasonably foreseeable that third
          parties would extend the risk; or
     3.   where the defendant knows or ought to know that a third party is creating a danger on his property and
          fails to take reasonable steps to bring it to an end.
       7.3.1.1 A novus actus interveniens
4. It may be the act of the claimant himself
• Where the claimant's lack of care for his own safety and the defendant's
   breach of duty are regarded as causes of the harm suffered, this is normally a
   question of contributory negligence but there are circumstances where the
   C's conduct may exonerate the defendant regarding the injuries suffered in
   the second event.
• The test is whether the C has acted reasonably.
• In McKew v Holland & Hannen & Cubitts (Scotland) Ltd [1969], as a
   result of the D's negligence the C sometimes lost control of his injured leg.
• The C attempted to descend a steep staircase with no hand rail while holding
   his young daughter by the hand. His leg gave way and, after pushing his
   child back, he jumped to avoid falling and broke his ankle. The C's
   decision to descend the staircase was the moment when he acted
   unreasonably.
• The risk which he took was unnecessary. This decision should not be
   confused with the later choice which he made when he decided to jump.
• In the agony of the moment such a choice might have been reasonable
      7.3.2 Remoteness of damage

• Even where the D's breach of duty is a cause in fact of the
  C's damage, damages may be denied on the grounds that the
  breach of duty was not the legal cause of some of the
  damage suffered.
• In these cases the damage in Q is said to be too remote.
• Policy issues are at work in this area as the court will not
  wish to impose an unfair or unduly heavy burden on the
  defendant or his insurers.
1. Re "Polemis“
2. The "Wagon Mound“
3. Extent of the harm suffered
4. The "thin skull" rule
                 7.3.2.1 Re “Polemis”

• At one stage it was sufficient that physical damage was a direct
  consequence of the D's breach of duty.
• This test was laid down in Re "Polemis " [1921].
• A plank was negligently dropped into the hold of a ship.
• Petrol vapour in the hold was ignited by a spark caused when the plank
  was dropped.
• The ship was destroyed in the ensuing fire: "Once the act is negligent,
  the fact that its exact operation was not foreseen is im111aterial."
• This test was very generous to the C, but, conversely, the scope of
  potential tortious liability in negligence was very narrow at the time, b4
  Donoghue v Stevenson [1932].
         7.3.2.2 The “Wagon Mound”
• The direct consequence test was considered and rejected by the Privy Council in The "Wagon
    Mound" (No.1) [1961].
•   The D negligently discharged fuel oil into Sydney Harbour.
•   Sometime later the oil spread to the C's wharf, where welding operations were in progress.
•   A spark from a welding torch ignited the oil and caused considerable fire damage to the
    wharf.
•   The oil also caused fouling to the wharf.
•   The trial judge found that it was not foreseeable that fuel oil on water would catch fire, but
    that some foreseeable damage in the form of fouling was caused.
•   It followed that there was a duty of care and a breach of that duty, but the Privy Council
    held that the D was not liable for the fire damage.
•   It applied a test for remoteness of damage of whether the type of damage suffered was a
    reasonably foreseeable consequence of the D's breach of duty.
•   As it was not foreseeable that the oil would catch fire on water, the fire damage was an
    unforeseeable type. The opinion of experts
•   Their Lordships expressed the opinion that Re "Polemis" should no longer be considered as
    good law (in the context of a negligence claim) because it was not consistent with ideas of
    "justice or morality that for an act of negligence, however slight or venial ... the actor should
    be liable or all consequences however unforeseeable and however grave, so long as they can
    be said to be 'direct' ".
1.7.3.3 Extent of the harm suffered

• Provided that the kind of damage is foreseeable, it does not
  matter that it is more extensive than could have been foreseen.
• In Vacwell Engineering Co v BDH Chemicals Ltd [1971], the
  D supplied a chemical but negligently failed to warn that it was
  liable to explode on contact with water.
• When the chemical was placed in water there was a violent
  explosion which resulted in extensive damage.
• The D was liable even though the extent of the damage was
  unforeseeable.
 1.7.3.4 The "thin skull" rule
• This rule is one aspect of the more general principle that the D must take
  his victim as he finds him. The name of the rule - "egg-shell skull" or
  "thin skull" - does not denote one type of physical weakness only; it is
  a graphic title to indicate a C who suffers to a far greater extent than
  a person without the physical xst would do.
• Thus, a small bruise might create serious risk to the health or life of a
  hemophiliac, whereas in another person the ill-effects of a bruise would be
  over in a matter of hours or days.
• In Smith v Leech Brain [1962], a negligently inflicted burn on the lip
  caused an employee to develop cancer. The employee had a pre-malignant
  condition giving him a predisposition to develop the disease. The D were
  liable for the damage resulting from the C's death even though death itself
  was not foreseeable. It is clear that this m]e survives
• The "Wagon Mound" and will extend to situations where negligently
  inflicted injury is exacerbated by medical] treatment to which the claimant
  is allergic
   Remoteness: some other torts

• It is now established that the reasonable foreseeability of type of damage
  test applies to nuisance: The "Wagon Mound" (No.2) [1967] and to the
  rule in Rylands v Fletcher [1868].
• Where the defendant intends to do harm, he should be more extensively
  liable than where he is merely negligent. So, in deceit cases, the defendant is
  liable for all the damage flowing from his fraud: Smith New Court
  Securities Ltd v Scrimgeour Vickers (Asset Management) Ltd [1996].
• Where foreseeability of harm is not an element in establishing
  liability, the Re "Polemis" direct consequence test of remoteness
  of damage is still valuable and widely used.
  Causation and remoteness: policy
  issues
• Issues of causation and remoteness raise difficult questions which are
   decided by the courts on a mixture of legal principle and policy.
• One illustration is where the claimant suffers injuries as a result of the D's
   breach of duty and he becomes depressed and commits suicide.
• The Q is whether the court wishes to compensate the estate or Ds of a
   suicide.
• There are a number of ways in which they can approach this.
    • Was the suicide caused by the breach of duty?
    • Was the death too remote a consequence of the breach?
    • Was the suicide a novusactusinterveniens of the claimant?
    • Could the deceased be regarded as being contributory negligent in taking his own life?.
  Summary
• The standard approach to determining causation between breach of duty and
   damage is the "but for" test - but for the defendant's negligence, would the claimant
   have suffered the damage? This test is sometimes called "factual causation".
• Where there are several possible causes, the burden lies on the claimant to prove on
   the balance of probabilities that it was the defendant's act which caused the harm.
• In certain limited circumstances the law might allow that where the claimant cannot
   prove which of several events caused the damage, it will be sufficient to show that
   the behaviour of the defendant materially increased the risk of harm. The
   circumstances most likely to give rise to the "material increase in risk" approach are
   where the parties are in an employer/employee relationship and the damage is non-
   traumatic, or in cases of failure to warn of medical risk.
• The law is reluctant to compensate for "loss of chance" of recovery in physical
   injury cases. If the claimant cannot establish that the defendant's negligent act was
   more than 50 per cent likely to have caused the harm, he will receive no damages at
   all.
 Summary
• Where there are multiple successive causes, the court will apply the "but
  for" test to each potential defendant or each potential cause.
• The negligent or deliberate act of a third person might break the chain of
  causation between the defendant's act and the damage. Whether the
  defendant will be liable for the act of the third party will depend on the
  foreseeability of the act of the third party. Where the act of the third party
  is a deliberate act, the court will also look at the degree of control the
  defendant had over the third party.
• The test for remoteness of damage is to determine what of the damage
  suffered should be attributed to the defendant. It would not always be fair,
  just and reasonable to attribute to the defendant all the damage suffered,
  when some of that damage would have been completely unexpected.
  Remoteness is sometimes known as "legal causation".
 Summary
• The test for remoteness in most torts is a test of reasonable foreseeability:
  what damage should a reasonable person in the position of the defendant
  have foreseen as a result of his negligent act?
• The test of remoteness for some old torts, such as trespass, is the "direct
  consequences" test: the defendant is liable for all the direct consequences
  of his act.
• Where the claimant suffers extra, unforeseeable damage because of a
  particular sensitivity to harm on the part of the claimant, the "thin skull"
  rule will apply - the defendant must take his victim as he finds him.
• Issues of policy will playa part in the determination of remoteness of
  damage and, increasingly, policy has begun to determine the approach to
  factual causation
7.4 Vicarious & employer’s liability

• Every person is obviously liable for his own wrongful acts. Liability in this case is
   personal.
• In certain circumstances, however, a person may assume responsibility for torts
   or wrongful acts committed by another person, e.g. an employer may be held
   responsible for the torts of his employee.
• Liability in this latter case is categorized as vicarious liability. So it is the liability
   of one person on the behalf of the other person.
• There must be Master/Servant relationship between the parties concerned.
• The Servant must have been acting in the course of his employment at the
   material time.
• This explains why employers often find themselves being sued for torts
   committed by their employees.
7.4 Vicarious & employer’s liability

• Century Insurance Co. v. N.I. Road Transport Board, (1942)
• The driver of a petrol tanker, whilst transferring petrol from the lorry to
   an underground tank, struck a match to light a cigarette.
• He threw the lighted match on the floor, and this resulted in a fire and an
   explosion that caused considerable damage.
• Held: The driver’s employers were liable for his negligence in the
   discharge of his duties.
• Cases like the one given above are straightforward and present no
   problem in determining whether the wrongdoer is or is not a servant.
• Sometimes, however, it is difficult to tell whether a particular person is a
   servant.
  7.4.1 Vicarious & employer’s liability:
           Who is a servant(S)?
• A person employed under a contract of service and acts on the orders
  of his master (M).
• The M controls the manner in which the S work is done.
• But an independent contractor is employed under a contract for services
  and himself determines the manner in which the work in question is
  done: He does not act on the orders of his employer and is his own
  master as regards the execution of the work he is employed to do.
• Thus, if A owns a vehicle and employs B to drive it for him, B is A’s
  servant; but where A is not the owner of the vehicle and engages B (the
  owner or driver) on special hire to drive him to some place(s), B is not a
  servant but an independent contractor.
  7.4.1 Vicarious & employer’s liability:
           Who is a servant(S)?
• Again where A engages B to build a house for him, and A himself
  directs the manner in which the work is to be done, supervising the work
  to ensure that his directions are complied with, B is a servant;
• but where A engages B, a professional builder and relies on his expertise
  and refrains from interfering with the construction work, B is in this case
  an independent contractor.
• The distinction between a S and an independent contractor is important
  because an employer is liable for the wrongful acts of his employee only
  if the latter is his servant; he is not liable where the employee is an
  independent contractor. An independent contractor is personally liable
  for his own wrongful acts.
7.4.1.1 Vicarious & employer’s liability:
         Course of Employment
• An act is said to have been done by a servant in the course of
  employment where it is proved to have been authorized or sanctioned by
  his M.
• Thus, where the M authorizes his S to do a wrongful act or where the S
  is authorized to do a particular act in a proper manner, but does it in a
  wrongful and unauthorized manner, the M is still responsible for the
  consequences of the act.
• What is important is the fact that the act was authorized by the M. Once
  the M’s authority is proved it is considered as the responsibility of the
  master and he is declared as liable for this tort.
• Indeed, the fact that the M has expressly prohibited a particular act is of
  no consequence at all, as long as the servant has the M’s general authority
  to act in the matter in Q.
7.4.1.1 Vicarious & employer’s liability:
         Course of Employment
• An act is said to have been done by a servant in the course of
  employment where it is proved to have been authorized or sanctioned by
  his M.
• Thus, where the M authorizes his S to do a wrongful act or where the S is
  authorized to do a particular act in a proper manner, but does it in a
  wrongful and unauthorized manner, the M is still responsible for the
  consequences of the act.
• What is important is the fact that the act was authorized by the M. Once
  the M’s authority is proved it is considered as the responsibility of the
  master and he is declared as liable for this tort.
• Indeed, the fact that the M has expressly prohibited a particular act is of
  no consequence at all, as long as the servant has the M’s general authority
  to act in the matter in Q. See: Limpus v. London General Omnibus Co., (1862) ;
  Rose v. Plenty, (1976); Beard v. London General Omnibus, (1900); Storey v. Ashton, (1869)
 7.4.1.2 Vicarious liability in practice
• Besides Employer/Employee relationship (including Government/Servant
   relationship) there are certain other instances in which the principle of vicarious
   liability applies.
• Law of agency: a Principle is liable for torts committed by his Agent, where such
   torts are committed in the course of the Agent’s duties.
• Parent/Child relationship, too, may give rise to vicarious liability on the part of
   the Parent. But a parent or guardian is generally not liable for torts committed by
   his child unless he has been negligent in permitting his child to use a
   dangerous thing or in failing to exercise proper control and supervision of the
   child: See Newton v. Edgerloy, (1959)
• A father allowed his 12-year old son to use a shotgun. He ordered the son never to
   use it in the presence of other children but failed to ensure that his order was
   obeyed. While the son was using the shot-gun, he injured the plaintiff.
• Held: The father was vicariously liable for the son’s tort.
• Also since a corporation is an artificial person, most of its tortious liability is of
  a vicarious nature.
          7.4.1.3 Liability for independent
                      contracts

• An employer is not liable for the torts of an independent contractor or of any
   servant employed by the contractor.
• This rule has been based on the fact that the employer does not have strict right
   of control over the method used by the contractor.
• But there are some exceptions to this rule. It means an employer will be still liable
   for the actions of an independent contractor in the following cases:
• (a) Where the employer retains his control on the contractor.
• (b) Where contract made is itself a tort e.g. a nuisance.
• (c) Where the Rule in Rylands v. Fletcher, (1866) applies
             7.4.2.1 Who is an employer
• An employer is vicariously liable for torts committed by an employee in the course of his
    employment. The expressions "employer" and "employee" will be used here
    instead of the traditional terms "master" and "servant".
•   If a C wishes to take advantage of the principle, he must show that a tort was
    committed by a person who was an employee (as opposed to an independent
    contractor) and that the tort was committed in the course of the tortfeasor's
    employment.
•   Vicarious liability is strict in the sense that the employer need not be guilty of
    personal fault. Vicarious liability should therefore be contrasted with the personal duty
    of care which the employer owes to the claimant who is one of his employees
•   The imposition of vicarious liability is based on the employer's greater ability to pay.
    The employer can pass his costs on to the customers in the form of higher prices
    and in any case is likely to be insured.
•   The risk-creating activity arises from the pursuit of the employer's business interests and
    that the doctrine may have the effect of encouraging the employer to effect
    accident prevention procedures.
•   Since the employer acquires a benefit from the work of his employees (usually some
    financial gain), the employer should also bear the burden of accidents which arise out of
    that work.
    7.4.2.2 Who is an employee

• Traditionally, a distinction was drawn between a contract of service
   made with an employee and a contract for services made with an
   independent contractor, but this does not explain how a judge will
   determine which is which.
• An integration test has been suggested under which a person
   is an employee if his work is an integral part of the business.
   It is therefore possible to distinguish between a chauffeur
   (employee) and a taxi driver (independent contractor); a
   staff reporter (employee) and a freelance journalist
   (independent contractor). Even this test does not solve all
   problems and more complex criteria have been suggested.
     7.4.2.2 Who is an employee
• In Ready Mixed Concrete v Ministry of Pensions and National
   Insurance [1968] the following criteria were put forward:
     1. the employee should agree that, in consideration of a wage or
         some other remuneration, he will provide his own work and
         skill in the performance of some task for his employer;
     2. the employee agrees expressly or impliedly to be subject to his
         employer's control;
     3. the other provisions of the contract should be consistent with it
         being a contract of service or employment.
• In this way the court can look at all the aspects of the contract and
   the relationship which may have a bearing on the decision, including
   the economic reality of the situation.
    7.4.2.2 Who is an employee
• In the end the court will take a pragmatic approach to the
  employment relationship.
• In Hawley v Luminar Leisure pIc [2006] the defendant was
  the owner of a nightclub and he used a security services
  company to provide doormen for the club.
• The D, however, exercised detailed control not only over what
  the doormen were to do but how they were to do it.
• A doorman assaulted the C and the D was found by the CoA
  to be the employer for the purposes of vicarious liability.
         7.4.2.2 Who is an employee
• Changes in patterns of employment and social trends may also be
  relevant. The questions of control, integration and economic reality must
  be asked in the context of responsibility for the overall safety of the worker.
  A builder/ roofer who had traded as a "one-man firm" for 10 years was
  nonetheless an employee of the defendants at the critical time of his
  accident. In answer to the question "Whose business was it?", the Court of
  Appeal decided that it was the employer's: Lane v Shire Roofing [1995].
• It has now been decided that no employment or apprenticeship
  contract is formed between a pupil barrister and the pupil master:
  Edmonds v Lawson [2000]. As a consequence, the pupil has no duty to
  "work" and cannot claim the minimum wage.
• Where an employee is lent to another employer, it may be necessary to
  determine who is the employee's employer for the purposes of
  vicarious liability. A term in a contract is not decisive and the burden is on
  the permanent employer to show that he had divested himself of control.
  Where labour only is lent it is easier to infer that the hirer is the employer.
      7.4.2.2 Who is an employee
• Where labour and plant are lent it is more difficult to rebut the
   presumption that the permanent employer retains control. In
   Mersey Docks and Harbour Board v Coggins and Griffiths
   (Liverpool) Ltd [1947], Lord Porter gave his view as to the most
   satisfactory test in this context:
• " …… to ask who is entitled to tell the employee the way in which he is to do
   the work upon which he is engaged. If someone other than his general employer
   is authorized to do this he will, as a rule, be the person liable for the employee's
   negligence. But it is not enough that the task to be performed should be under
   his control, he must also control the method of performing it."
    7.4.2.3 Tort committed by employee
• Vicarious liability is a means whereby, in appropriate circumstances, one person is made
    liable for the tort committed by another person. It is sometimes easy to overlook the
    pre-requisite that a tort must have been committed by an employee of the D for the
    question of vicarious liability to arise.
•   In Ministry of Defence [2007] the C, a serving member of the RAF, was raped in her
    room by G, who had been invited back to the C's accommodation block by a mutual
    friend.
•   Both G and the friend were also members of the RAF and all three of them had been
    drinking together at a nightclub. The C sought to establish that the first defendants
    should be vicariously liable for her friend's failure to escort G off the premises.
•   The trial judge found no vicarious liability and also no breach of any personal duty of
    care owed by the first defendants to the C regarding the standard of locks at the
    accommodation block or failure to enforce the rules relating to male visitors leaving the
    premises.
•   Those in residence at the accommodation blocks were adults and not children. The C's
    friend did not owe a duty of care to the claimant and there was no tort for which the
    Ministry of Defence could be "vicariously" liable.
•   This essential principle, that an employer is vicariously liable for the tort of an
    employee committed in the course of his employment, was affirmed by the HoLs in
    Generale Bank Nederland NY v Export Credits Guarantee Department [1999].
       7.4.2.4 Course of employment

• The employer will only be responsible for torts committed in the course of
   employment by the employee. This is a question of fact but the courts have
   often used Salmond's definition that an act is in the course of employment if it
   is either:
    1. a wrongful act authorised by the employer; or
    2. a wrongful and unauthorised mode of doing some act authorized by the
         employer. (When an employee is outside the course of employment he is
         said to be on a "frolic of his own".)
• It is possible for an employer to be liable for an act which he has prohibited if
  the prohibition applies to the way in which the job is done rather than the scope
  of the job itself. An employer of a bus driver was liable when the driver raced
  other buses contrary to instructions: Limpus v London General Omnibus Co
  [1862].
       7.4.2.5 Employer and independent
       contractor – non-delegable duties
• In principle, an employer is not liable for the torts of his independent contractor.
   There are some situations, however, in which the employer remains primarily
   responsible even though the incident in question was caused by the act of an
   independent contractor.
• The employer will be primarily, as distinct from vicariously, liable where the employer
   has a non-delegable duty which cannot be discharged by an independent
   contractor, for example, the employer's duty of care to his own employees.
• Such a non-delegable duty might arise where the employer hires an independent
   contractor to undertake a task which is inherently dangerous. This was made clear in
   Honeywill and Stein v Larkin Bros [1934] and confirmed in Bottomley v
   Todmorden Cricket Club [2003], where the owner of the cricket club was held
   liable for the negligence of independent contractors putting on a pyrotechnics display
   at the club. A non-delegable duty will also arise where an independent contractor has
   been hired to undertake a task on or adjoining a highway which puts at risk
   persons in a public place
               7.4.2.6 Principal and agent
• The employer is vicariously liable for the torts of his employees committed in the
    course of employment because of the relationship between employer and employee,
    out of which the incident involving a third party arises.
• Another special type of relationship recognized by law is that between principal and
    agent.
• There are some situations where liability for the torts of an agent will be attributed to
    the principal for whom the agent is acting. The following two cases can be compared
    in this context. In the first, Ormrod v Crosville Motor Services Ltd [1953],
    Denning LJ stated:
• "The owner [of a car] is ... liable the driver is his agent, that is to say, the driver is, with the
    owner's consent, driving the car on the owner's business or for the owner's purposes ... The law puts
    an especial responsibility on the owner of a vehicle who allows it out of the road in the charge of
    someone else no matter whether it is his servant, his friend, or anyone else. If it is being used wholly
    or partly on the owner's business or for the owner's purposes, then the owner is liable for any
    negligence on the part of the driver:"
                                         Summary
• The main application of vicarious liability in tort law is in relation to liability of employers for tortious
    acts of employees. An employer is liable for tortious acts of employees committed in the course of
    employment.
•   Whether the claimant is an employee will be determined by looking at:
      • how much control the employer had over the worker;
      •    the extent to which the worker was part of the employer's organisation;
      • other practical information, such as the contract and method of payment.
• Whether the employee is acting in the course of employment will be determined by looking at:
      • what the employee was employed to do;
      • whether the employee was doing generally what he was employed to do at the time of the
          tortious act;
      • whether the employer benefited from the employee's tortious act;
      • the degree of connection between the employment and the act;
      • whether the employer had prohibited the tortious act and the nature of that prohibition;
      • whether the employee was on a "frolic of his own".
                          Summary

• In certain circumstances an employer might be held primarily liable for the
  tort of an independent contractor. This will be the case where there is a
  "non-delegable" duty owed by the employer. This will be particularly so
  when:
    • the employer is a hospital and the claimant is injured by the negligence
       of someone working in the hospital;
    • the employer has employed the independent contractor to carry out a
       task that was particularly dangerous;
    • the employer has employed the contractor to work on or adjoining a
       public highway;
    • statute imposes a non-delegable duty.
      7.5 Vicarious liability: Employer’s
                   liability
• The employer's liability in tort for the safety of his employees may take one of
   three forms:
     • The employer may be vicariously liable for the tort of an employee which
        leads to the claimant employee (or a third party) being injured.
     • Liability here is strict in the sense that the employer need not be personally
        negligent. (See 7.4 .)
     • The employer may be in breach of a statutory duty and the C employee
        suffers injury as a result.
     • The employer may be in breach of the personal duty of care which he owes
        to the employee. Liability here is in negligence. See 5.2 for the essential
        distinction between an employee and an independent contractor.
• The same tests are applicable in the current context, since the duty of care arises
   from the contract of employment itself.
    7.5 Vicarious liability: Employer’s
                 liability
• Consider a building site of which X is the occupier.
• Those workmen who are employees of X can sue for breach
  of personal duty of care which X owes to them, but other
  workers, who are independent contractors, or employees of
  Z, cannot take advantage of the personal duty of care owed
  by X to his own employees.
• These other workers may, however, be able to argue vicarious
  liability if it is one of X's employees who causes an accident.
• X may, in addition, incur liability as occupier of the siteand Z
  will have a duty of care to his own employees.
7.5.1 Employer's personal duty of care
                         (read attached notes)



1.   Duty to take reasonable care for the safety of employees
2.   Duty to non-employees?
3.   Duty does not extend to pure economic loss
4.   Duty in relation to work stress
5.   Competent staff
6.   Plant and appliances
7.   Premises
8.   Safe system of work
          7.5.2 Breach, causation and
                  remoteness

• Performance of the duty of an employer to an employee is discharged
  by the exercise of due care and skill.
• Breach of duty is determined by reference to what the reasonable
  employer, of that type and in that line of work, would be expected
  to do to keep the employee safe.\
• Causation and remoteness of damage are determined in the same way as
  for negligence.
                     7.5.3 Defences

• Both volenti non fit injuria and contributory negligence can be raised
  by the employer in his defence.
• The courts are, however, conscious of the dulling effect on a worker of
  repetitive tasks in noisy conditions and the lapses which can occur
  when the routine of work is too familiar.
• Proportions of contributory negligence will usually be low.
• Volenti is rarely successful in this context and consent to a risk
  should not be inferred from the apparent willingness of the employee
  to continue in the job.
• Many pressures, including economic ones, influence a worker to keep a
  job, however inherently dangerous it may be: Smith v Baker [1891].
                                Summary
1.   An employer owes a particular duty to take care for the safety and welfare of
     employees.
2. The duties of an employer to an employee are recognised at common law as:
     • the duty to provide a safe place of work;
     • the duty to provide competent fellow employees;
     • the duty to provide safe appliances and equipment;
     • the duty to provide a safe system of work.
3. The duty may include a duty to protect against psychiatric harm resulting from
occupational stress. The employer is required to do all that a reasonably prudent
employer, taking positive care for the safety and well-being of his employees, would
do to monitor and protect against occupational stress.
4. Where the claimant is arguing that the employer has breached the duty to provide a
safe place of work, competent employees and a safe system of work, the standard of
care will be that of the reasonable employer in that line of business.
5. Where the claimant is arguing a breach of the duty to provide safe appliances and
equipment, statute has imposed strict liability provided that the equipment was
negligently manufactured.
6. The defences to negligence will apply, although the court will take into account the
balance of power between the parties when applying the defences.
       7. 6 General defences of tort
• A person sued in tort has at his disposal certain defences, some of which
   are restricted to particular torts (e.g. contributory negligence is a defence
   only to the tort of negligence), while other are of a general defences.
• The following general defences are available to a defendant in every
   action for tort where they are appropriate:-
    (i) Volenti non fit Injuria: Agreement; Knowledge; voluntariness;
    (ii) Inevitable Accident.
    (iii) Act of God
    (iv) Necessity
    (v) Self-defence
    (vi) Mistake
    (vii) Statutory Authority
    (viii) Exemption Clauses (or Disclaimers)
    (ix ) contributory negligence: fault of C; Causation; apportionment
    (x) Ex tupri causa
                               7. 6 Capacity

     • The general rule is that any person may sue or be sued in tort.
     • All persons are subject to the same laws.
     • However, some special rules apply in certain circumstances which either restrict,
       forbid or qualify the right to sue or be sued.
     • It means certain persons cannot sue, while some other persons cannot be sued.
     • Capacity: capacity of parties or persons to sue or to be sued in law of torts.
1.    Government:                              6. Corporation
2.    Infants and minors:                      7. Trade Unions (TUs)
3.    Husband and wife:                        8. Persons of unsound mind:
4.    President:                               9. Aliens and non citizens
5.    Head of States and Diplomats
                         7.6 Capacity
The Government:
• The Government Proceedings Act (Cap 40) makes the Government subject to
  liabilities in tort as if it were a private person of full age and capacity.
• Section 4 (1) of this Act provides that the Government is liable:
• (a) in respect of torts committed by its servants or agents;
• (b) in respect of any breach of those duties which a person owes to his servants or
  agents at common law by reason of being their employer; and
• (c) in respect of any breach of the duties attaching at common law to the
  ownership, occupation, possession or control of property.
• The Government is also liable for statuary torts i.e. torts arising from breach of a
  duty imposed by statute.
• However, the Government is not liable for any thing done or omitted to be done by
  any person while discharging any responsibilities of a judicial process (Sec: 4(5).
• The Government is not also liable for torts committed by public officers who are
  appointed and paid by local authorities, or members of public corporations like
  Kenya Railways, Maize and Produce Board of Kenya etc.
                                7.6 Capacity
Infants and Minors:
• As a general rule minority is no defence in tort.
• Infants can sue and be sued in the same way as any other person.
• However, the age of an infant may be relevant in some torts where intentions,
   malice, or negligence of the wrongdoer are the main cause of the tort.
• In the case of negligence, the infant may not have reached the stage of mental
   development where it could be said that he should be found legally responsible for
   his negligent acts.
• A child may be also guilty of negligence if old enough to take precautions for
   his own safety.
• In AG v. Vinod, (1971) E.A., a child aged 8½ years was held partly to blame for an
   accident.
• An infant may not be liable in tort in a case which is a breach of contract.
• Similarly, an infant will be liable in tort if this tort is independent of a contract.
•   See Jennings v. Randall, (1799)
•   An infant hired a mare for riding (not necessary).
•   He injured the animal by overriding her and was sued in tort for damage.
•   Held: The infant was not liable in tort for negligence since this act was mainly a
    breach of contract.
                            7.6 Capacity
Husband and Wife:
• The position of husbands and wives in tort is covered by two English statutes.
   These are: the Married Women’s Property Act 1882 and the Law Reform
   (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act, 1935.
• The former Act is a statute of general application in Kenya
• A married woman is liable in tort and may sue or be sued in tort in the
   same way as though she were a female sole (i.e. a single or unmarried
   woman).
• A wife can sue her husband in tort for the protection and security of her
   property.
• In Kenya, a husband is still liable for his wife’s torts.
• Both husband and wife have the capacity to sue and be sued in tort.
• At common law a husband could not sue his wife in tort, and a wife could
   not sue her husband in tort except for the protection of her own property.
                                     7.6 Capacity
The President
• Art. 143 of COK 2010 stipulates that enjoys protection from legal proceeding
• Art. 143 (1) Criminal proceedings
• Art. 143 (2) Civil Proceedings
• Art. 143 (4) Limits that immunity: Shall not extend to a crime for which the President may be
   prosecuted under any treaty to which Kenya is party and which prohibits such immunity (ICC_
   President Uhuru _ Crime Against humanity).
• President enjoy protection: No civil or criminal proceedings can be instituted against him while in office
Heads of State and Diplomats:
• The Heads of foreign states, diplomats of foreign missions and certain other persons connected to them
   are immune from the jurisdiction of the local courts.
• Their immunity is provided by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, signed in 1961,
   refer“The Privileges & Immunities Act (Cap. 179)”.
• The accredited diplomats and their staff families enjoy immunity from the criminal and (subject
   to specified exceptions) from the civil and administrative jurisdiction of the local courts.
• The immunity does not extend to Kenyans who are employed by diplomatic missions.
• Reps of the UN Organization & its specialized agencies can also claim diplomatic immunity.
• Although the diplomats and their staff cannot be sued under the law of tort but it is always open
   to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to declare a diplomat ‘persona non grata’, thereby requiring his
   removal from Kenya.
                                      7.6 Capacity
Corporations
• The corporations can sue and be sued in their own names: liable to actions in tort.
• A corporation is also liable for torts committed by its servants and agents.
• But if a servant of a corporation commits a tort which is ‘ultra vires’ (beyond the powers) then the
   corporation is not liable for some torts of personal nature e.g. personal defamation, battery etc.
Trade Unions:
• The TUs have capacity to sue in tort but actions against them in tort are limited.
• Section 23 of the Trade Unions Act (Cap. 223) provides that no action shall be brought against a
   trade union for torts committed by its members of officials in respect of any act done in
   contemplation or in furtherance of a trade dispute.
• For example, if a trade union calls a strike, it cannot be sued by an employer for the tort of inducing
   a breach of contract.
• A trade union can be sued for breach of contract. The members and officials of a trade union
   can be sued for actions in tort committed in their personal capacity.
Persons of Unsound Mind:
• These are generally liable in tort unless an intent is a necessary element and their condition is such that
   they could not have formed such intent.
• In Morriss v. Marsden, (1952). D took a room at a Brighton hotel. While there he attacked the
   manager of the hotel (plaintiff).
• It was established that D was suffering from disease of the mind at the time of the attack; that he knew
   the nature and quality of his act, but he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.
• Held: That as D knew the nature and quality of his act he was liable in tort for the assault and battery.
• It was immaterial that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. .
                       7.6 Capacity
Aliens or Non-Citizens
• An alien is under no disability and can sue and be sued.
• However, an enemy alien cannot sue, but if sued can defend himself.
Judicial Officers
• Judicial officers are protected from civil liability for any act done or
   ordered by them in the discharge of their judicial functions.
• Thus, where a judge or magistrate utters words which tend to reflect
   on a person’s reputation, or orders a party’s property to be attached in
   satisfaction of a judgment-debt, no action can respectively be brought
   against him for trespass.
• Besides judicial officers, officers of the court are also protected
   against civil liability for acts done in pursuance of a judicial order or
   warrant.
• A court broker cannot be sued for attaching property under a warrant
   duly issued by court, as long as he acts within the powers conferred
   on him by the warrant.
• The protection to judicial officers and officers of court is afforded by
   the Judicature Act (Cap. 8) Section 6.
                                  7.6 Capacity
Artificial legal persons
• Corporations
• A corporation (an artificial legal person), for example, a limited company, may be vicariously
   liable in tort for the actions of its members or employees.
• It can also commence actions in its own name.
• A corporation, although an artificial as opposed to a real person, may even have torts
   attributed to it which require some mental element; for example, malice of an employee
   acting in the course of his employment will render the corporate employer vicariously liable
   in a tort such as injurious falsehood.
• The circumstances in which a director of a company may be personally liable for the
   economic loss suffered by a claimant who relied upon advice given by a company are set out
   in Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd [1998].
• Such individual liability can only arise if the director had assumed personal responsibility for
   the advice provided by the company to the C and the C had reasonably relied upon that
   assumption of responsibility.
• In Williams there were no personal dealings between the director and the claimants; no
   communication (verbal or by conduct) which would have indicated that the director was
   taking personal responsibility.
• Not all torts are capable of being committed against a corporation e.g., it could hardly be
   falsely imprisoned - but many other torts can be committed against the corporation's
   property, for example, in negligence, nuisance, etc.
• Even defamation can be committed against a company if the defamation relates to the
   company rather than its members or employees personally.
                                7.6 Capacity
Limited Liability Partnerships
• A limited liability partnership (LLP) may be set up by two or more persons who are
  prepared to undertake registration formalities in order to be associated for the purpose
  of carrying on business with a view to profit.
• In return, they secure limited liability, except for their own tortious acts.
• Such a partnership is set up under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000.
• The UP is a separate legal entity and actions are taken against the partnership.
Unincorporated bodies
• Partnerships
• A partnership is not a distinct legal person separate from the partners and so actions by
  or against a partnership must be in the names of the partners, although the partners
  may sue or be sued in the name of the firm. Partners are jointly and severally liable for
  the torts of the other partners: Partnership Act 1890.
• 6.4.3.2 Other bodies
• It is far from clear what capacity entities such as trade unions or clubs have to sue or be
  sued. It may be possible to sue members individually responsible - eg, a governing body
  or committee - and make them personally liable. Rules of court provide for the
  possibility of a representation order, whereby certain members only of a body are
  allowed to take or defend proceedings in the interests of the whole membership.
                 7.6.1 Capacity to sue
• Apart from procedural requirements, for example, that a minor must sue by his
   "litigation friend", there is no distinction between an adult and a minor for the
   purposes of commencing an action.
• The Congenital Disabilities (Civil Liability) Act 1976 (CD(CL)A 1976)
   provides that a child born alive and disabled may have a light of action in respect
   of torts committed upon it whilst it was 'in the womb.
• Born is defined in s4(2) as being born alive, that is, the moment when a child first
   has a life separate from its mother and disabled as being born with any deformity,
   disease or abnormality, including predisposition ... to physical or mental defect in
   the future.
              7.6.2 Capacity to be sued
• (1) There is no defence of infancy as such in tort. A negligent driver of 17 will be
   held as liable as a driver who is a year older. In the case of torts involving negligence
   (and particularly in the case of contributory negligence), the judges have held that
   the proper standard of care to be expected from a child is what a reasonable child of
   that age would be capable of achieving (Mullin v Richards [1998]).
• (2) A parent is not, as such, liable for the torts of his child unless he is liable
   under some separate principle, for example, if the parent was also the employer
   of the child or if a parent authorised the commission of a tort by the minor.
• In the general law of negligence, a parent, or person standing in the position
   of a parent, may be personally liable if there was a failure to control the child
   properly - for example, by giving the child a dangerous thing such as an air rifle, or
   failing to supervise him properly, or allowing a small child to wander on a busy road
   so that he causes an accident.
• In such circumstances the tort is that of the parent and is quite separate from any
   tort which the child may have committed.
               7.6.2 Capacity to be sued
Joint and several tortfeasors
• No special rule applies if two or more people cause one claimant different injuries. The
   claimant may sue each tortfeasor separately for the injury each has caused.
• Where two breaches of duty or other tortious acts cause one single injury the position is
   more complex.
• The basic position is that the claimant can sue all or any of them and each individual is
   wholly liable for the full extent of the harm although the claimant can, of course, only
   recover his loss once.
• Example: At an unmarked crossing, cars negligently driven by A, Band C collide. X, a
   pedestrian on the pavement, is injured. X may sue either A, Bore, or may issue one writ
   against all three. If judgment is given against all of them for, say, £10,000, X may recover
   this whole amount from any of A, Band C, leaving the person he chose to sue to obtain
   any appropriate contribution to this sum from the others.
• The importance of this rule in practice is obvious: if only one of several Ds is solvent,
   the claimant can enforce judgment against him alone and thus the rule favours the
   claimant. In the above example, the court would go on to establish the relative
   contributions of each defendant to the accident, for example, A - 40 per cent, B - 30 per
   cent, C - 30 per cent. If X chose to pursue A for the whole of the £10,000, A, having
   paid X, would be entitled to contributions of £3,000 each from Band C.
               7.6.2 Capacity to be sued
The Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978
• The Civil Liability (Contribution) Act 1978 (CL(C)A 1978) substantially repeals the Law
  Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors) Act 1935 which first provided for contribution
  between joint tortfeasors .
• s.1 provides that any person liable in respect of any damage suffered by another may recover a
  just and equitable contribution, such contribution being fixed by reference to his respective
  responsibility for the tort. So, the court will decide on the Ds' respective degree of blame for the
  tort and apportion percentage liability in precisely the same way that liability is apportioned
  between C & D, where an issue of contributory negligence arises.
• Laws LJ identified three possible sub-divisions of concurrent torts:
• "(1) where the injury in question would not have occurred but for the two torts, for example, two
  people acting independently shoot at X, who dies of his injuries, but neither gunshot in itself"
  would have led to his death;
• (2) where either tort could have resulted in the injury suffered by the claimant, for example. two
  people acting independently shoot at X, who dies of his injuries, and either shot would have
  been enough to kill him;
• (3) (a) each tortfeasor caused some part of the damage; but (b) neither caused the whole; and (c)
  some part (hut not all) of the damage would therefore have been occasioned to the claimant It if
  only one tort - either of them - had been committed but on the evidence it is impossible to
  identify with any precision what part or elel1'lent of the damage had been caused by which D."
         7.6. Capacity to be sued
• Contribution of the claimant
• The courts are often required to consider the allocation of responsibility
   between multiple defendants and a claimant who has been contributory
   negligent. Such a situation arose in Fitzgerald v Lane [1988].
• The claimant attempted to cross the road at a pelican crossing when the lights
   were red for pedestrians and green for the traffic.
• He was hit by the car of Dl and thrown into the path of D2. The House of
   Lords identified the correct approach to this problem.
• First, the claimant's contributory negligence should be assessed against the
   totality of both Dl's and D2's conduct (i.e. apply the provisions of the Law
   Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945) and, second, consider the
   proportionate blame of the separate tortfeasors.
• On the facts of the case, the claimant was 50 per cent to blame and the two
   defendants were required to contribute equally to the remaining 50 per cent of
   the claimant's losses.
                            7.6.3 Summary
(1) The Crown is now generally liable for the torts of its employees.
(2) Foreign sovereigns cannot be sued in English courts unless immunity has been waived.
(3) In some circumstances there is immunity from suit in tort, in particular in relation to the
giving of evidence in court.
(4) A corporation may be liable in tort in relation to most torts and can sue in tort.
(5) A partnership cannot be sued or sue in tort, but can be sued or sue in the names of
individual partners.
(6) A minor can sue and be sued in tort, though to sue in tort the minor must sue through a
"litigation friend".
(7) A child can sue under statute for injuries which occurred in utero, provided that the child is
born alive. The child can sue for injuries inflicted on its parents which resulted in damage to the
child. The child can sue its father. The child can sue its mother only in relation to road traffic
accidents.
(8) If several people are responsible for the claimant's damage, the claimant can sue all or any of
the tortfeasors, and each individual tortfeasor can be found liable for the full extent of the harm.
(9) One tortfeasor made liable for the full extent of the claimant's harm can sue, under statute,
for a contribution to the damages from the other tortfeasors.
(10) In such a case the claimant may also be required to bear a portion of the damages if he is
found to be contributory negligent.
               7.8 Remedies

• Remedies are of two kinds.
• Judicial remedies are orders made by a judge, such
  as an award of damages or an injunction.
• Extra-judicial remedies are those in which the
  claimant takes some form of self-help, such as
  abatement of a nuisance.
             7.8.1 Types of damages
1. Non-compensatory damages: Non-compensatory damages may take one of three forms.
(1) Nominal or contemptuous damages
• Nominal damages are awarded to recognise that a legal right has been violated but the
    claimant has suffered no loss. A small sum of money is awarded. Such an award might be
    recovered in an action for trespass to land where the trespasser has caused no damage to
    the claimant's land. Contemptuous damages are awarded to demonstrate the opinion of the
    jury that the claimant should not have brought the action at all. They consist of the lowest
    coin of the realm and are usually awarded only in libel actions. An example can be found in
    Grobbelaar v News Group Newspapers (No.2) [2002] (see 19.2) where a sum of £1
    was awarded in an award substituted by the House of Lords for the original jury award.
(2) Aggravated damages
• Where compensatory damages do not sufficiently reflect the manner in which the tort was
    committed, the court may make an award of aggravated damages.
• Commission of a tort in an insulting, malicious, insolent or high-handed way may warrant
    aggravated damages, particularly where little compensable physical or psychiatric harm has
    been suffered, or where the defendant committed the tort to make a profit. For example, in
    Appleton v Garrett [1996], the defendant dentist advised his patients that they needed
    significant dental work. The work was, in fact, unnecessary and was recommended for the
    financial benefit of the defendant. Aggravated damages are most frequently awarded in
    libel actions (e.g. John v Mirror Group Newspapers [1996]).
            7.8.1 Types of damages
1. Non-compensatory damages: Non-compensatory damages may take one of three
forms.
• (3) Exemplary damages
• Exemplary damages are awarded to punish the defendant for his conduct and to deter
    such behaviour in the future. They are awarded in addition to compensatory
    damages. The circumstances in which exemplary damages may be awarded are set out
    in the speech of Lord Devlin in Rookes v Barnard [1964]. Since the principle of
    punishing the defendant is inconsistent with the aims of the civil law of tort, such
    damages can only be awarded for certain torts and in very limited types of case, as
    follows:
• (a) For oppressive, arbitrary or unconstitutional action by persons holding public
    positions, for example, Government departments, the police, or local authority
    employees.
• (b) Where the defendant's conduct has been calculated to make a profit for himself
    which will exceed any compensation which he will be ordered to pay. This could
    occur in a defamation action where the publisher hopes to take advantage of the
    publicity that a trial will bring
• (c) Where a statute permits the award. Exemplary damages were claimed in AB v
    South West Water Services Ltd [1993] by those who suffered as a result of
    drinking and using the contaminated water in Camelford.
           7.8.1 Types of damages
2. Compensatory damages
• Compensatory damages are to compensate the claimant for actual harm done
   and are appropriate in torts that require actual damage.
• Damages may be either general or special.
• (1) General damages are those which do not need to be specifically pleaded
   and can be argued for at the trial. They are those which are presumed to follow
   from the tort: for example, in an action for personal injury based on negligence,
   general damages include damages for pain and suffering, loss of amenity, future
   loss of earnings, etc.
• (2) Special damages consist of financial loss of specific amounts, such as loss
   of earnings up to trial, damage to a vehicle, cost of private medical treatment,
   etc. These losses must be pleaded and proved by the claimant.
             7.8.1 Types of damages
2. Compensatory damages
• Compensatory damages are to compensate the claimant for actual harm done and are
   appropriate in torts that require actual damage.
• Damages may be either general or special.
• (1) General damages are those which do not need to be specifically pleaded and can be argued
   for at the trial. They are those which are presumed to follow from the tort: for example, in an
   action for personal injury based on negligence, general damages include damages for pain and
   suffering, loss of amenity, future loss of earnings, etc.
• (2) Special damages consist of financial loss of specific amounts, such as loss of earnings up to
   trial, damage to a vehicle, cost of private medical treatment, etc. These losses must be pleaded
   and proved by the claimant.
Purpose of compensatory damages
• The purpose of an award of compensatory damages is, as far as money can do so, to place the
   claimant in the position he was in before the tort was committed. The interest of the claimant
   protected is the reliance interest.
                   7.8.2 Non-pecuniary loss
•  A claimant may be entitled to compensation for personal injuries.
•  The House of Lords has been given an opportunity to consider the meaning of "bodily injury" as used in
   Art 17 Warsaw Convention on International Carriage by Air 1929: King v Bristow Helicopters Ltd;
   Morris v KLM Royal Dutch Airlines [2002]. In King the claimant suffered as a consequence of a
   sudden loss of height of the helicopter in which he was travelling. The helicopter crashed back onto the
   helideck and King suffered minor post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms which led to a peptic ulcer.
   Morris was travelling as an unaccompanied minor on a flight during which she woke to find that the man
   sitting next to her had placed his hand on her thigh. She was distressed at the time and suffered a single
   episode of clinical depression on her return home.
Pain, suffering and loss of amenity
• Damages may be recoverable for suffering attributable to the injury itself or any consequences of the
   injury. Factors which the courts will take into account will include:
• length of hospitalisation;
• number of surgical treatments;
• type of treatments;
• permanent disability;
• diminution in quality of life;
• diminution in length of life;
• loss of childbirth or marriage prospects;
• cosmetic injury;
• psychological or emotional harm .
• The size of the award will be determined in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Judicial
   Studies Board.
                        7.8.3 Pecuniary loss
• In personal injury actions where the claimant suffers serious injury as a result of the
   defendant's negligence, pecuniary loss will constitute a large element of the claim.
• 8.4.1 Loss of earnings
• The claimant's loss of earnings before the trial must be pleaded as special damages and he will
   recover his net loss.
• Future loss of earnings is recoverable as general damages. The court starts with the claimant's
   net annual loss (the multiplicand) and deducts from the gross income, which the claimant
   expected to earn, income tax, social security contributions, etc.
• Example: a 30-year-old man who is totally unfit for work. Net annual loss £10,000. Multiplier
   of 15. Damages for future loss of earnings = £150,000.
The lost years
• If the claimant suffers a reduction in his "working" life expectancy as a result of the tort, then
   the difference between pre-accident and post-accident life expectancy is known as the "lost
   years". This head of damage was first recognised by the House of Lords in Pickett v British
   Rail Engineering [1980], but the principle involved is not without its critics
).
                         7.8.3 Pecuniary loss
Future medical care and attention
• The claimant is entitled to recover all expenses reasonably incurred as a result of the treatment
   of his injuries. The claimant has a free choice as to whether to be treated privately or not. If
   the claimant is spared living expenses by virtue of being cared for at public expense in a
   hospital or similar institution, a deduction will be made to avoid over-compensation.
Deductions
• As regards accidents occurring after January 1989, almost all social security benefits will be
   deducted in full by the defendant from the damages and paid to the Department for Work and
   Pensions (DWP) (s.22 and Sch. 4 Social Security Act 1989 now contained in Part IV Social
   Security Administration Act 1992).
Interest on damages for personal injury
• A judgment debt carries interest until it is paid.
• No interest is given on general damages for loss of future earnings; other general damages
   attract interest at 2 per cent from the date of service of the writ to the date of judgment (or
   payment, if earlier). For special damages, that is, financial losses up to the date of trial, the rate
   is half the short-term interest rate.
• Death
• Where the defendant in an action dies, the cause of action generally survives against his estate.
   Where the claimant dies, his action generally survives for the benefit of his estate and a new
   action is created for his dependants.
                         7.8.3 Pecuniary loss
Death
• Where the defendant in an action dies, the cause of action generally survives against his estate.
  Where the claimant dies, his action generally survives for the benefit of his estate and a new
  action is created for his dependents.
• Dependents
• Any dependent may claim; a detailed list of dependents is provided by s.1(3) FAA 1976. It
  includes past and present spouses, civil partners, ascendants (parents, grandparents) and
  descendants, illegitimate children, relationships by affinity and consanguinity. Actions are
  normally brought by spouses, parents or children. FAA 1976 allows an action by a cohabitee
  where the parties had lived together as man and wife for two years immediately preceding the
  date of death.
• Financial dependence
• The action is essentially one for the loss of a breadwinner. It is a new action given to the
  dependents, not a survival of the deceased's action. The dependents must, however, show that
  the deceased had a right of action.
• Pure economic loss
• The basis of the action is that the dependents receive compensation for their economic losses.
  The main head of damages is pecuniary losses suffered from the date of death. These are
  assessed in two stages: first, from the date of death to the trial, on the basis of the deceased's
  earnings, less the amount he would have spent on himself; second, from the date of the trial
  into the future. (For example, the deceased was a 30-year-old man, married with two children,
  with a net income of £10,000 per annum with no promotion prospects
                           7.8.3 Pecuniary loss
• Bereavement
• Certain dependants have a claim for damages for bereavement. A fixed sun is
    reference to the Retail Price Index. The first such increase ha raised the current
    figure of £10,000 to £11,800 where the cause of action ariSe after 31 December
    2007: the Damages for Bereavement (Variation of Sun (England and Wales)
    Order 2007.
•   One action only
•   s.2(3) FAA 1976 states that: No more than one action shall lie for and in respect of the same
    subject matter of complaint. A potential injustice, which might have been created by the
    application of this provision, was avoided in Cachia v Faluyi [2002].
•   Provisional damages
•   Since 1970, awards for personal injuries have been itemised to facilitate the
    assessment of interest. A single "lump sum" remains the most common method of
    receiving damages but there is now the possibility of an award of "provisional
    damages" under s32A Supreme Court Act 1981. This provision provides the
    opportunity to assess the damages at two separate stages if:
•   ... there is proved or admitted to be a chance that at some definite or indefinite time in the future
    the injured person will, as a result of the act or omission which gave rise to the cause of action,
    develop some serious disease or suffer some serious deterioration in his physical or mental condition.
                   7.8.3 Pecuniary loss

• Periodical payments
• Traditionally, damages have been awarded in the form of a single lump sum. On 1
   April 2005, s2(1) DA 1996 came into force to enable the court to order an award in
   the form of periodical payments. Each party in a claim for damages for personal
   injury may state whether periodical payments or a lump sum is more appropriate
   for all or part of the award of damages.
• Consequential economic loss
• If the claimant's property is damaged or destroyed by the tort of the defendant, the costs of
   reasonable repair or replacement provide an obvious measure of loss. When the property in
   question is land, the fall in market value of the land provides a measure for damages. Several
   cases have considered the application of these general rules to the calculation of
   compensatory damages following reliance on a negligent valuation of real property
                       7.8.4 Injunctions

• An injunction is an order of the court requiring the defendant to do some act or refrain from
   doing some act.
• Injunctions are either mandatory, requiring the defendant to do some positive act, such as pull
   down a building or erect a fence, or prohibitory, requiring the defendant to refrain from some
   continuing act (e.g. a nuisance) or not to repeat it (e.g. a defamation).
• Injunctions may be either final or interlocutory.
• (1) Final injunctions are those awarded at the end of the trial] as one of the
• remedies obtained by the successful party.
• (2) Interim injunctions are those awarded pending the trial of the action in order to prevent
   harm where damages alone, if the claimant were successful, would not be an adequate remedy.
   The court should consider whether the balance of convenience favours the grant of an
   injunction: American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd [1975].reliance on a negligent valuation
   of real property
                       7.8.4 Injunctions

• Specific restitution
• Where a defendant has un]awfully taken the claimant's goods and is found liable in conversion,
   the court has a discretionary power to award the specific restitution of the article in addition
   to damages. This discretion is unlikely to be exercised where the article in question is an
   ordinary article of no special value; in such a case damages alone will adequately compensate
   (see 18.6).
7.8.6 Miscellaneous other remedies
• (1) An aggrieved person may in certain instances avail himself of self-help, although it is true
   to say that the law does not generally favour this.
• (2) Self-defence.
• (3) Re-entry on land.
• (4) Recovery of chattels. A person may use reasonable force to re-take any chattel of his which
   is unlawfully taken or kept from him. If the wrongfully taken goods are on the land of some
   third party, who was not responsible for the taking in question, there is no clear answer as to
   whether the rightful owner may go on to the land to recover them. It is suggested that there is
   such a right if the article got there by accident or by the criminal act of the wrongdoer.
• (5) Abatement of nuisance.
• (6) Distress damage feasant.
                                    Summary
(1) A claimant in tort may be awarded the following types of damages:
     • nominal or contemptuous damages;
     • aggravated damages;
     • exemplary damages;
     • compensatory damages.
(2) The common law has placed limits on the circumstances in which
     • aggravated and contemptuous damages can be awarded.
(3) Compensatory damages for personal injury consist of the following awards:
     • the award for pain, suffering and loss of amenity;
     • the award for loss of earnings, calculated on the basis of a multiplicand representing lost
         annual net earnings and a multiplier representing the number of years of earnings lost;
     • the award for future medical care and attention, calculated on the
       projected
     • annual costs of care as a multiplicand and a multiplier representing the
       number of years of care required;
     • special damages, representing the financial loss between accident and date
       of trial;
     • interest.
                             Summary
(4) Deductions will be made to recoup some of the sums paid to the claimant
in benefits.
(5) Compensatory damages for death will consist of:
     • a claim by the beneficiaries of the victim's estate, on behalf of the
        victim, for funeral expenses, property damage suffered in the accident
        and any pain and suffering the victim suffered between accident and
        death;
     • a statutory claim by the dependants in their own right for their loss of
        dependency. This will be calculated on a multiplicand and multiplier
        basis;
     • a claim of £11,800 for bereavement by a spouse or civil partner of the
        victim or by the parents of a minor child killed in an accident.
(6) In relation to continuing torts such as nuisance, trespass and harassment,
the claimant may seek an injunction to prevent future commission of the tort.
(7) In certain circumstances the claimant may exercise other remedies such as
self dr efence, abatement or re-entry on land.
                             7.9 Defamation
• Defamation is a tort which protects the claimant’s reputation.
• As such, it does not directly protect claimants from intrusion into their private life, but
    against wrongful attacks to their reputation.
•   This has a number of consequences.
•   First, although abuse in private may be hurtful, defamation will only occur when a third
    party knows of the allegations – that is, when the claim has been published.
•   Further, it is irrelevant that the defendant did not intend to harm the claimant – this will not
    prevent the claimant’s reputation being harmed, although it may, as we shall see, provide the
    defendant with a defence.
•   We must also now look at defamation in the light of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 and,
    in particular, Article 33 which deals with freedom of expression.
•   Paragraph 3 of Article 33 expressly states that the exercise of freedom of expression must
    be weighed against the need to protect the reputation or rights of others.
•   The law of defamation must therefore strike a balance between protecting claimants against
    untrue statements which attack their reputation and the freedom of the defendant to
    express his or her views.
•   This becomes particularly significant in relation to the press. Students must therefore be
    aware of the fundamental human rights issues arising from this particular tort
                    7.9.1 Libel and slander
• This becomes particularly significant in relation to the press. Students must therefore be
   aware of the fundamental human rights issues arising from this particular tort
• Defamation is a tort which protects the claimant against attacks to his or her reputation.
   This may occur in a number of ways.
• The attacks may be spoken, written, indicated by gestures or conduct or even expressed in
   sign language or in code.
• The law divides these modes of communication into libel and slander. Libel generally takes
   permanent form, while slander is temporary.
• This is a relatively crude distinction, but remains part of Kenyan law. On this basis, text or a
   photograph in a newspaper will amount to libel.
• Shouting insults in the classroom will be deemed to be slander.
• Slander, due to its temporary nature, is considered to be less serious. Whereas the courts
   will presume that harm occurs as a result of libel – it is actionable per se – the claimant
   must prove that the slander resulted in special damage; for example, as a result of the
   slander, his or her business lost money. Equally the loss must not be too remote: Lynch v
   Knight (1861) 9 HLC 577. Libel, unlike slander, is also a crime, although few prosecutions
   are made.
• Innuendo
                       7.9.1 Libel and slander
• Defamation is not confined to direct attacks on the claimant’s reputation. To protect the
    claimant’s reputation, defamation must also include implied or veiled attacks, which are generally
    known as ‘innuendo’. There are two types of innuendo: true (or legal) and false (or popular).
•   A true innuendo is a statement where the attack is truly hidden in the absence of special facts
    and circumstances, which the claimant must show are known by some of the people to whom
    the statement is published. Tolley v J.S. Fry & Sons Ltd [1931] AC 333 is an example of this. Here,
    a famous amateur golfer alleged that a caricature of him had appeared without his knowledge or
    consent in an advertisement for Fry’s Chocolate. This, in itself, was not defamatory. However,
    Tolley claimed that for people who knew of his amateur status it would imply that, contrary to
    acceptable amateur conduct, he had accepted money. The House of Lords held the
    advertisement to be capable of bearing the meaning alleged. People knowing of Tolley’s amateur
    status might think less of him and therefore his reputation would be diminished.
•   Publication
•   The tort of defamation seeks to protect the claimant’s reputation. Statements will only harm the
    reputation if third parties are aware of them. Publication, that is communication of the
•   This is obviously satisfied by the printing of an article in a newspaper or book or shouting a
    remark in front of other people, provided the words are intelligible to the third party. Problems
    arise; however, when the defendant alleges that he or she did not intend to publish the statement
    and that it was meant to be a private remark between the claimant and defendant.
                           7.9.2 Defences
1. Justification or truth (section 14)
• Defamatory statements are presumed to be untrue, unless the defendant proves otherwise.
    Truth (or justification) is thus seen as a defence. It is irrelevant that the defendant’s
    intention was malicious (contrast fair comment and qualified privilege).
2. Fair comment (section 15)
• This defence serves to protect defendants who seek to criticise claimants, provided they act
    fairly, honestly and base their comments on true facts. It clearly supports freedom of
    expression, but within a controlled environment.
      • Fair comment has three requirements:
      • the statement must be in the public interest
      • it must be a comment on true facts
      • it must be honest and fair.
3. Privilege: There are two types of privilege in English law: absolute and qualified
• Absolute privilege
• . Absolute is the stronger form of privilege and applies on occasions where the need to
    protect freedom of speech is so important as to create an absolute defence to any action for
    defamation, irrespective of the motives or words of the author.
• Qualified privilege
• This is a weaker form of privilege. It will only apply on occasions where it is desirable that
    freedom of speech should be protected, but not where the author is activated by malice:
    see Horrocks v Lowe [1975] AC135.
                        7.9.2 Defences
• Qualified privilege at common law: The courts look for two requirements:
   • That X had a duty or interest in communicating the information to Y. This
          may be legal, moral or social.
      • Y has a corresponding interest in receiving the information in question.
4. Innocent dissemination
• This defence is found in section 13, Defamation Act Cap 36. It is now a defence
    to show that:
• the defendant is not the author, editor or commercial publisher of the statement
• the defendant took reasonable care in relation to the publication
• The defendant did not know, nor had no reason to believe, that what he or she
    did caused or contributed to the publication of a defamatory statement.
5. Unintentional defamation
• Sections 13 of the Defamation Act Cap 36establish a procedure whereby a
    person who inadvertently defames another can publish an apology and correction
    and pay an agreed sum of compensation to the claimant. This is not, therefore, in
    strict terms a defence –indeed to (s.13 (1) (a)) – but a form of settlement
    avoiding the potentially huge costs of defamation litigation.
                  7.9.2 Defences

5. Unintentional defamation
• Under section 13, the defendant must be prepared:
    • to admit that he or she was wrong (or partly wrong)
    • to offer in writing to make a suitable correction and apology
    • to publish the correction and apology in a manner that is
        reasonable and practicable in the circumstances
    • To pay the claimant such compensation (if any) and such costs as
        may be agreed or determined to be payable.
6. Consent
• It is a defence if the claimant has expressly or impliedly consented to the
   publication of the defamatory matter: Cookson v Harewood [1932] 2 KB
   478n; Chapman v Lord Ellesmere [1932] 2 KB 431.
                7.9.3 Remedies

• There are two main remedies:
• damages and injunctive relief.
• They may include an award for aggravated damages (where the
  defendant’s conduct has led to additional mental distress) and exemplary
  damages (where the defendant deliberately sets out to profit at the
  expense of the claimant’s reputation).
• Attention should also be drawn to Article 33 of the COK 2010 which
  ask the courts to have particular regard to freedom of expression when
  considering whether to grant a remedy which might affect this right.

The biggest differences between the two countries are over
the duration of filling up the dam on the Blue Nile, which
supplies nearly 80 per cent of Egypt’s water.

Ethiopia says it will take two to three years to fill the dam
before the natural flow resumes, while Egypt is pushing for
gradual filling of between seven and 10 years.

“The second claim is that Dr. Dre tore up the

Andre acknowledged to me that he felt ashamed
he had pressured me into signing a premarital
agreement and he tore up multiple copies of the
agreement in front of me,” she wrote. “Since the
day he tore up the agreements we both
understood that there was no premarital
agreement, and that it was null and void.”

Creative credit
A Russian man, after deciding he wasn’t happy with the terms of a
credit card offer he received in the mail, took it upon himself
to rewrite the contract to include zero percent interest, no fees, and
no credit limit. His added clauses also promised penalties to the
bank should it fail to hold up its end of the agreement or attempt to
cancel the contract. He signed it, and the bank did too, not noticing
the amendments.When the bank filed a lawsuit against the for
unpaid balance and related fees, the court ruled in the man’s favor,
requiring him only to pay the balance on the card, not the extra fees.

       Definition of a contract


          A legally binding agreement.
Nature
• Agreement between parties … meeting of minds.
• Legal.
• Binding.
• Compliance with the Law of Contract Act.
       Definition of a contract
• a promise made or set of promises a breach of
  which the law provides a remedy and the
  performance of which the law recognizes as a duty
  or an obligation.
• all contracts are agreements, all agreements are
  not contracts.
             Benefits of a contract

•   Identity of parties … natural/artificial
•   Purpose or objective
•   Rights and duties of parties are defined – expectations
•   Terms of engagement are defined
•   Duration of the engagement
•   Provision of dispute resolution mechanism
•   Governing laws are identified
                    Scenarios

1. If you are buying land, what do you think will be
   important to be included in the contract?


2. How about a diamond ring from an individual in South
   Africa?


3. How about in an employment contract?
      Classification of contracts

• Express and implied contracts




• Unilateral, bilateral and multilateral contracts
          Elements of a contract

•   Contractual capacity of parties
•   Offer
•   Acceptance
•   Consideration
•   Intention to create legal relations
•   Legality
•   Possibility of performance
•   Formalities
        1. Contractual capacity

Persons who are competent to contract:

           ✓ A natural or artificial person.

                   ✓ A sane adult.
         Contractual capacity

i. Adults – have full legal capacity.
ii. Legal/Corporate persons – full legal capacity.

           Qualified contractual capacity
i. Minors.
ii. Persons of unsound mind and drunken persons.
iii. Aliens or non citizens.
                           Minors

• A contract made by minors may be binding or void/not
   binding.

• Binding - Contract for the supply of necessaries.

• Under the Sale of Goods Act “necessaries” are defined
   as “goods suitable to the condition in life of a particular infant or
   minor, and to his actual requirements at the time of the sale and
   delivery”.
                     Minors

                Nash v. Inman (1908)
A tailor supplied an infant with eleven (11) fancy
waistcoats but the infant failed to pay. The infant was a
university undergraduate. His father gave evidence that
the infant was adequately supplied with proper clothes
according to his station in life.

Held: The clothes were NOT necessaries and the
infant was not liable to pay for them.
                    Insanity

A contract entered into by a person of unsound mind is
voidable at his option by establishing that:
• He was too insane to understand his acts and;
• The other party was aware of his mental condition.
• By avoiding the contract, the party pleading insanity
   escapes liability on it.
Drunk persons
                Drunk persons
Mathews v Baxter (1873) Baxter, while drunk, agreed at an
auction to purchase a property. Once sobriety returned he
decided that he wished to affirm the contract that had been
made by him while drunk. Sometime later he had a change of
mind and he sought to rescind the contract, arguing that he
lacked capacity to enter the contract by reason of intoxication.
The court held that because Baxter had confirmed the contract
it was no longer open to him to avoid the contract on the
grounds of intoxication. This was despite the fact that he had
made out the necessary element of this defence.
                    2. Offer
➢ An invitation to enter into a contract.

➢ Issued by an offeror.

➢ Can be oral, written or implied from conduct of an
  offeror.

➢ Must be communicated to the offeree.
                     3. Acceptance

• An acceptance is an approval of the terms of an offer.

• Can be oral, written or implied.

• Must be communicated to the offeror within the
  stipulated time.

• Silence doesn’t amount to acceptance.
        Agreement

Offer         Acceptance
               4. Consideration

• The “price”.
“an act or promise offered by the one party and
accepted by the other party as price for that others
promise.”

Patterson J. in Thomas v. Thomas “consideration means
something which is of some value in the eye of the law
moving from the plaintiff. It may be some benefit to the
defendant or detriment to the plaintiff but at all events it
must be moving from the plaintiff.”
               Consideration

• Parties have the freedom to agree on the amount or
  form of consideration.

• It need not be adequate that is measuring up to the
  worth of goods in the transaction or subject of the
  contract.
                   Consideration

• Must be legal.

• Real/Valuable.
         5. Legal relationship


Parties to a contract must have intention to create a
legal contract.
               Social agreements
                 Mrs. Balfour v. Mr. Balfour (1919)
The plaintiff and defendant were husband and wife. The husband,
a civil servant in Ceylon, was on leave and he decided to travel
home to England with his wife.Towards the end of the leave the
wife got sick and she had to remain in England while the husband
returned to Ceylon. The husband promised her 30 pounds per
month for maintenance while she recovered in England. Later,
when the husband defaulted, the wife sued him over his unfulfilled
promise.

Held: The husband’s promise did not give rise to legal relations
and so the wife’s action could not be maintained.
                 6. Legality

• Legal/lawful
              Illegal contracts


1. Contracts to commit a crime, tort or fraud.

2. Contracts that are prejudicial to the administration
    of justice.

3. Contracts liable to corrupt public life.
                 Illegal contracts

4. Contracts that are prejudicial to public safety.
